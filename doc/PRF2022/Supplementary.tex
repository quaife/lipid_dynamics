{\bf Movie S1. Relaxation} 
There are 60 circular particles with radius 0.5 that are initially confined in a square box.
 The simulation results show the relaxation with the use of all three boundary condition

%form a self-enclosed bilayer structure. The simulation result shows the vesicle relaxation and the fluid pressure inside the JP vesicle decreases to 0 after a period of time.
%The color field from blue to red shows the magnitude of fluid pressure and the range from 0 to 0.1. All dark blue dots in the domain represent the tracers in fluid that move with respect to calculated fluid motion.
%This movies includes a total 5000 time steps where the time step is $\Delta t=0.2$.\\



\noindent
{\bf Movie S2. Structures in a Shear Flow without Ruptures} 
%We adopt the relaxed configuration and place the JP vesicle in the shear flow. The simulation result shows a tank-treading motion when the shear rate is $\chi=0.005$.
%The colored field from dark blue to dark red shows the magnitude of hydrophobic attraction activity and the range is from 0 to 1. All white dots in the domain represent the tracers in fluid that move with respect to calculated fluid motion.
%This movies includes a total 20000 time steps where the time step is $\Delta t=0.2$.\\

\noindent
{\bf Movie S3. Structures in a Shear Flow with Ruptures} 
%Using the same setup demonstrated in Movie S2, we show the simulation result for 
%inter-monolayer slip by tracking a pair of particles (blue and yellow). After $t=4000$, 
%the yellow particle in the outer leaflet surpasses the blue particle in the inner leaflet by the distance about 1 particle diameter.
%This movies includes a total 20000 time steps where the time step is $\Delta t=0.2$.\\


\noindent
{\bf Movie S4. Structures in a Taylor-Green Flow without Ruptures} 
%The numerical results show that the JP vesicle starts to have rupture phase at the shear rate $\chi=0.0655$. The colored field from dark blue to dark red shows the magnitude of hydrophobic attraction activity and the range is from 0 to 1. All white dots in the domain represent the tracers in fluid that move with respect to calculated fluid motion. This movies includes a total 3000 time steps where the time step is $\Delta t=0.2$.\\


\noindent
{\bf Movie S5. Structures in a Taylor-Green Flow with Ruptures} 
%There are two relaxed JP vesicles suspended in a shear flow. The two centroids are at coordinates $(-25,0)$ and $(25,0)$ in nm. The colored field from dark blue to dark red shows the magnitude of hydrophobic attraction activity and the range is from 0 to 1. All white dots in the domain represent the tracers in fluid that move with respect to calculated fluid motion. This movies includes a total 20000 time steps where the time step is $\Delta t=0.2$.\\
