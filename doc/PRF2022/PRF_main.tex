%\section{\label{}}
Janus particles are colloids with two surfaces of different properties such as hydrophobicity. For example, it is common for the surface of a Janus particle to
be partly hydrophilic and hydrophobic (polar and non-polar). In a viscous solvent Janus particles often self-assemble into structures with tunable functions for biomedical engineering applications \cite{GheisariSahfieeAbbasiEtAl2021_DMR,LiuYangHuangEtAl2016_Angew,LiWangYaoEtAl2019_Nanoscale}. Depending on the interactions between Janus particles and the surrounding viscous solvent, JPs self-assemble into oligomers of various geometries and sizes. 

{\bf The following paragraph needs to be rephrased and inserted in the introduction.
"Dynamics offers yet another dimension of control that emerges naturally from the interactions between particles and fluid in colloidal matter. ....Such active colloidal systems show nonequilibrium self-organization with complexity rivaling that of biological systems such as living cells, bacterial baths, and animal flocks.....long-standing challenges such as the ``inverse" problem of creating a colloidal system that will self-assemble into a prescribed structure.....the framework of geometrical frustration, which has been used to explain dis-ordered systems, could be used to design new ones instead, through specific choices for the shapes or interactions of the particles....\cite{Manoharan2015_Science}"}



The many-body hydrodynamics of amphiphilic Janus particles (JP) suspended in a viscous fluid (at zero Reynolds number) has been studied using
boundary integral numerical simulations \cite{Fu2022_JFM}. Janus particles consist of both a hydrophobic and a hydrophilic surfaces. 
Immersed in a viscous solvent, the dynamics of a JP suspension results from the combination of long-range hydrodynamic interaction and non-local
interactions between JPs through the distribution of a hydrophobic potential (HAP). In a quiescent flow, numerical simulations of a 
JP suspension showed self-assembly into micelles and bilayers of JPs that provide an alternative means for computing the 
mechanical moduli of a colloidal membrane.

Under background flows, the hydrodynamics of a JP vesicle (a
self-enclosed bilayer of JPs) exhibit many familiar behaviors of a
vesicle \cite{Fu2022_JFM}: 
Elongation and alignment along the extensional direction, tank-treading, and rupture of a vesicle under shear flow.

In this work we take advantage of the flexibility of the model to examine the effects of boundary condition on JP surfaces that could be controlled based on the chemicals used in the experiments, for example.

\section{Governing Equations: Hydrophobic Attraction Potential Mobility Problem} 
The governing equations are a nonlinear system for the position and
orientation of a collection of rigid Janus particles. We first pose the
Stokes equations for the mobility problem giving the hydrodynamic
interactions for the particle suspension. The hydrophobic forces come
from solving a screened Laplace equation. Particle collisions are
avoided through a near-field, pair potential.

\subsection{Mobility problem}
A suspension of $N_b$ Janus particles is immersed in a viscous solvent.
The domain $\Omega(t) \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ is the solvent phase and $t$
is time. The particles are disks of radius $c$, center $\aa_i$, and
orientation $\theta_i$ relative to the horizontal axis. The boundary of
$\Omega$ is $\bd\Omega = \Gamma_1 \cup \cdots \cup \Gamma_{N_b}$, where
$\Gamma_i$ is the boundary of Janus particle $i$. Assuming inertial
terms are negligible, we have 
\begin{alignat}{3}
\label{eq:stokes}
  -\mu \Delta \uu + \nabla p &= \mathbf{0}, && \xx \in \Omega, \\
  \nabla\cdot \uu &= 0, \qquad && \xx \in \Omega, \\
  \uu - \uu_\infty &\to \mathbf{0}, && |\xx| \to \infty,
\end{alignat}
where $\uu$ is the velocity of the solvent, $p$ is the pressure,
$\uu_\infty$ is the background flow velocity, and $\mu$ is the constant
viscosity. The solvent velocity satisfies the no-slip boundary condition
for a rigid body motion
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:rigid-vel}
  \uu(\xx) = \vv_i + \omega_i (\xx - \aa_i)^\perp, 
    \quad \xx \in \Gamma_i,
\end{equation}
where $\vv_i$ is the translational velocity, $\omega_i$ is the angular
velocity, and $\langle x, y \rangle^{\perp} = \langle -y, x\rangle$. 
Without inertia, the system in \eqref{eq:stokes}-\eqref{eq:rigid-vel} also satisfies the force-free and torque-free conditions.
This means that the total force $\FF_i,$ and torque $T_i$ from the hydrodynamic stress on each particle (with subscript `$i$')
are in balance with the force and torque from the hydrophobic potential \cite{Fu2022_JFM}.
The total force and torque from the fluid flow are computed as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:force}
 \FF_i \equiv \int_{\Gamma_i} \ssigma \cdot \nnu_i \, \dif s, \quad
 T_i \equiv \int_{\Gamma_i} (\xx - \aa_i)^\perp \cdot 
  (\ssigma \cdot \nnu_i) \, \dif s,
  \quad i=1,\ldots,N_b,
\end{equation}
where 
%$\FF_i \in \mathbb{R}^2$ and $T_i \in \mathbb{R}$
%are interparticle forces and torques. 
$\ssigma = -p \mathbf{I} + \mu \left(\nabla \uu + \nabla \uu^T
\right)$ is the hydrodynamic stress tensor (pressure tensor), and
$\nnu_i$ is the unit outward normal on the $i$th particle.

$\FF_i$ and $T_i$ are to be in balance with the force and torque from the hydrophobic interactions between the
particles and the viscous solvent. As in \citet{Fu2022_JFM} such a hydrophobic attraction potential $u(\xx,t)$ is assumed to
the minimizer of the free energy
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:free_energy}
F = \gamma
\int_{\Omega} \rho |\nabla u|^2 + \rho^{-1} u^2
\,d\xx
+ \frac{M}{2}
\sum_{j \neq i} 
P\left(\frac{|\aa_i - \aa_j|-2c}{\rho_0}\right), \quad
\end{equation}
where the hydrophobic attraction potential $u(\xx,t)$ can be regarded as an order parameter for the structure of water,
$\rho$ is a decay length, and $\gamma$ is an interfacial tension. 
$c$ is an ``effective" distance between particle centers, below which the steric repulsion between a pair of JPs becomes important.
In the followings we use the radius of JP for $c$.

The governing equation for $u(\xx,t)$ is obtained by computing the domain variation of the free energy $F$ \cite{Fu20}:
We obtain
a screened Laplace equation boundary value problem as a model for the hydrophobic interaction between water and JPs:
\begin{gather}
  \label{eq:SL}
  -\rho^2 \Delta u + u = 0,\quad \xx \in \Omega, \\
  u = g, \quad \xx \in \bd\Omega, \quad 
  u \rightarrow 0, \quad |\xx| \rightarrow \infty.
\end{gather}
The boundary condition $g$ gives the degree of hydrophobicity the
particle-solvent interface.

Variation of the the free energy \eqref{eq:free_energy} provides
\begin{equation}
  \FF_i = \int_{\Gamma_i} \mathbf{T}\nnu \, \dif s
  - \frac{M}{\rho_0}
  \sum_{j \neq i}
  \frac{\aa_i - \aa_j}{|\aa_i - \aa_j|}
P'\left(\frac{|\aa_i - \aa_j|-2c}{\rho_0}\right)
  ,\quad
T_i = \int_{\Gamma_i} (\xx - \aa_i)^{\perp}\cdot (\mathbf{T}\nnu) \, \dif s, 
\end{equation}
for $i = 1,\dots,N_b$. The term 
$
\mathbf{T}
= \gamma \left[ \rho^{-1} u^2 \mathbf{I}
  + \rho \left(|\nabla u|^2 \mathbf{I} - 2\nabla u \nabla u^T\right)\right]
$
is the hydrophobic stress identified in ~\cite{Fu20} and derived by
variation of the domain techniques.

The dimensionless repulsion profile $P$ takes the form $P(s) = 1 -
\sin(\pi s/2)$ for $0 \leq s < 1$ and $P(s) = 0$ for $1 \leq s <
\infty$.  As such, only those particles within a distance $\rho_0$ of
$\Gamma_i$ contribute to repulsion.  The parameter $M$ is the repulsion
modulus.

We use the parameters $\mu = 1$ cP, $\gamma = 4$ pN nm$^{-1}$,
$\rho = 5$ nm, $c = 1.25$ nm, $M = 2$ pN, and $\rho_0 = 0.5$ nm.

\subsection{Boundary integral represenation and time stepping}
We recast \eqref{eq:stokes}--\eqref{eq:rigid-vel} and \eqref{eq:SL}
as boundary integral equations (BIEs) and discretize each BIE at
$N$ points on each of the $N_b$ particles with a collocation method.
To express the solution of \eqref{eq:SL},
we adopt the double layer potential
\begin{align}
\label{eq:SL_BIE}
u({\bf x}) = \DD[\sigma](\xx) = \int_\Gamma \frac{\partial G(\xx-\yy)}{\partial \nnu_\yy}\sigma(\yy)\, \dif s_\yy
, \quad \xx \in \Omega,
\end{align}
where $G(\xx) = \frac{1}{2\pi}K_0(|\xx|/\rho)$ is the fundamental solution to the screened Laplace equation \eqref{eq:SL},
$K_0$ is the zeroth-order modified Bessel function of the first kind,
and $\sigma$ is a scalar-valued density function.
The subscript in $\dif s_\yy$ denotes integration with respect to $\yy \in \Gamma$. 
For the velocity, we use the representation [REF]
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:velocity}
  \uu(\xx) = \uu_\infty(\xx) + \DD[\eeta](\xx) + 
    \sum_{i=1}^{N_b} \left(\SS(\xx,\aa_i) \cdot \FF_i + 
    \RR(\xx,\aa_i) T_i\right), \quad \xx \in \Omega,
\end{align}
with the vector-valued density function $\eeta$,
Stokeslet 
$\SS(\xx,\aa_i) = \frac{1}{4\pi} \left(-\log |\rr|\mathbf{I} + \frac{\rr \otimes \rr}{|\rr|^2}\right)$,
and Rotlet
$\RR(\xx,\aa_i) = \frac{1}{4\pi} \frac{\rr^\perp}{|\rr|^2}$,
$\rr = \xx - \aa_i$ [REF].
    

Finally, together with \eqref{eq:velocity},
\eqref{eq:stokes}-\eqref{eq:rigid-vel} become 
\begin{alignat}{3}
  \label{eq:vel_BLM_rep}
  \vv_i + \omega_i (\xx - \aa_i)^\perp &= \uu_\infty(\xx)
    -\frac{1}{2} \eeta(\xx) + \DD[\eeta](\xx) 
    + \sum_{j=1}^{N_b} 
    \left(\SS(\xx,\aa_j) \cdot \FF_j + \RR(\xx,\aa_j) T_j\right),\\
  \label{eq:mobility}
  \int_{\Gamma_i} \eeta \, \dif s &= \mathbf{F}_i, \quad
  \int_{\Gamma_i} \eeta \cdot (\xx-\aa_i)^\perp \, \dif s = T_i,
\end{alignat}
for $\xx \in \Gamma_i$ and $i = 1,\dots,N_b$ [REF].

We discretize \eqref{eq:SL_BIE} and \eqref{eq:vel_BLM_rep}
using high-order interpolation-based quadrature rules.
Integrals that are smooth are computed with
the spectrally-accurate trapezoid rule, and nearly-singular integrals,
caused by close contact between two particles, are computed with a
high-order interpolation-based quadrature rule \cite{qua-bir2014}.

After discretizing and applying quadrature,
the result is an $NN_b \times NN_b$ and $2NN_b \times 2NN_b$
linear system for \eqref{eq:SL_BIE} and \eqref{eq:vel_BLM_rep}, respectively.
These are solved with matrix-free GMRES, and we guarantee that the number of
GMRES iterations is mesh-independent by using second-kind BIEs.

Once the translational and angular velocities $\vv_i, \omega_i$
have been determined, a second-order Adams-Bashforth scheme updates the particle
positions and orientations:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:adams-bashforth}
  \begin{aligned}
    \aa_i(t_{n+2}) &=
\aa_i(t_{n+1})
+ \tfrac{3}{2}\Delta t \vv_i(t_{n+1})
- \tfrac{1}{2}\Delta t \vv_i(t_{n}),\\
    \theta_i(t_{n+2}) &=
\theta_i(t_{n+1})
+ \tfrac{3}{2}\Delta t \omega_i(t_{n+1})
- \tfrac{1}{2}\Delta t \omega_i(t_{n}).
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\section{Equilibrium configurations}
\subsection{Boundary conditions and normalization}
The present paper considers boundary conditions of the form
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:bc-type}
g(\xx) = a(b + \cos \alpha),\quad a = (\pi c(2b^2 + 1))^{-1/2},\quad \xx \in \Gamma_i,
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$ is the angle between $\xx$ and  $\aa_i$, and 
$\dd_i = (\cos \theta_i, \sin \theta_i)$ isthe particle director.
The parameter $a$ normalizes the boundary conditions 
so that $\int_{\Gamma_i} g^2(\xx) \, \dif s = 1$.
The motivation for this normalization is that the hydrophobic attraction
part of the free energy converges to the integral of the square of the boundary
data in the zero-screening length limit.  
We refer to the side of the particle where $\alpha = 0$
as the tail and the side where $\alpha = \pi$ as the head. 

The boundary condition on JP can be put into three categories: min$(g) >0$, min$(g) =0$, and min$(g) <0$. Without loss of generality, 
these three categories correspond to three characteristic values of $b$ in \eqref{eq:bc-type}: $b=2$, $b=1$ and $b=0$, respectively. 
%
To see the effect of the shift parameter $b$, we simulate the dynamics of
198 particles and 60 particles in a quiescent flow as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:relax}.
Three distinct configurations emerge:
(i) bilayers for $b = 1$, 
(ii) multilamellar for $b = 2$, and 
(iii) striated for $b = 0$.

Figure~\ref{fig:relax}(a)shows the initial configurations with orientations of 198-particle and 60- particle cases,
respectively. 
Case (i) with $b = 1$, mimicks an amphiphilic particle.
The boundary condition $g$ is everywhere nonnegative,
takes the value $0$ on the
hydrophilic head (green),
and takes the maximum value $a$ on the
hydrophobic tail (red). 
The interaction is attractive, and particles collectively orient their
hydrophobic sides to form bilayers  (Figure~\ref{fig:relax}(b)). The inset shows the equilibrium 
state for 60-particle run.
Both cases form bilayers with multiple components. 

In case (ii) with $b = 1$, the boundary condition is everywhere positive.
It takes the maximum value $3a$ on tail (red) and the
minimum value $a$ on the head side (yellow). 
Both sides of the Janus particle are hydrophobic but
more so on the $\alpha = 0$ side.  
Over a short time scale, these particles also self-assemble into bilayers. But unlike for case (i),
the heads are also hydrophobic and so in the long-time dynamics
these bilayers form multilamella structures.
The number of folds depends primarily on the number of particles.
Figure~\ref{fig:relax}(c), for example, shows a
multilamellar structure with four layers and one with two layers in the inset.

In case (iii) with $b=1$,
a water structure with
positive/negative charge is possible \cite{MaRa76, Ma77}.
Here, the head repels the tail of other particles
and the particles initially form chains with their directors perpendicular
to the length of the chain.  
The chains form stria
where the particles lie on a 
square grid and the orientations alternate
between layers (Figure~\ref{fig:relax}(d)).

  Panel (a) shows that the free energy \eqref{eq:free_energy} decreases
    in the mobility problem formulation.  The initial energies
    are for the configuration in Figure \ref{fig:relax}(a)
    and the final energies are for the near-equilibrium
    configurations as shown in Figure \ref{fig:relax}(b)--(d), respectively.
    The solid curves are the energies for the $N_b=60$ cases and  
    the dashed curves are the energies for the $N_b = 198$ cases normalized
    by $60/198$, showing that the energy approximately scales with the number of
    particles. 
    Panel (b) shows the orientational parameters $\tilde{S}_2$ for all 6 relaxation runs. 
    The curve styles are identical to the ones in panel (a).
    The near-equilibrium configurations depend on the initial configurations and the results show that for both $N_b=60$ and $N_b=198$ cases, bilayer and multi-lamellar configurations have similar trends in orientational parameters.
    The results of the striated configuration, however, depend on the initial geometrical setup.

\section{Measuring deformation}
We use the free energy $F$,
a strain parameter $E$, 
and two scalar order parameters $S_{2}$ and $\tilde S_2$ to measure
the deformation of particle configurations under background flows. 

First, we must simplify the
form of the free energy \eqref{eq:free_energy}
using integration by parts and \eqref{eq:SL}
to obtain
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:free_energy2}
F = -\gamma
\int_{\Gamma} \rho g \nabla u \cdot \nnu \,\dif s
+ \frac{M}{2}
\sum_{j \neq i} 
P\left(\frac{|\aa_i - \aa_j|-2c}{\rho_0}\right).
\end{equation}
%
Here, we have substituted $g$ for $u$ since the boundary values are given.
However, evaluating $\nabla u \cdot \nnu$ on $\Gamma$ based on \eqref{eq:SL_BIE}
involves calculating a quadruple layer potential which has a
well-known obstacle in numerical implementation.
To overcome this obstacle, we use
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:normal_deriv}
\nabla u(\xx) \cdot \nnu(\xx)=
%\frac{\partial}{\partial \nnu_\xx} \DD[\sigma](\xx) =
-\frac{1}{\rho^2} {\bf t}_\xx\cdot \SSS[\sigma{\bf t}](\xx)
+ \frac{\dif}{\dif s}\SSS\left[\frac{\dif \sigma}{\dif s}\right](\xx), \quad \xx \in \Gamma.
\end{equation}
%
Here, ${\bf t}(\xx)$ is the tangent vector and $\dif/\dif s$ is the arclength derivative.
See the Appendix section \ref{sec:appendix} for the proof and details.
Substituting \eqref{eq:normal_deriv} into \eqref{eq:free_energy2} for the normal derivative
leads to single layer integral which is more straightforward to evaluate and we compute the
arclength derivative using spectrally accurate Fourier transform.
We have validated the form of \eqref{eq:normal_deriv} by extrapolating 
the primal energy \eqref{eq:free_energy} along test curves placed slightly
outside the particles. 

Figure~\ref{fig:relax_energy}(a) tracks the free energy profiles for all relaxation runs.
For the 198-particle cases, we normalized the energies by 60/198 and the results
show that all energies decrease with good agreements in all boundary conditions (dashed curves).
This can be considered as evidence that the free energy per particle with specified
boundary condtions is independent of number of particles.

To measure positional order, we use a number,
which we call the strain parameter, 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:SP}
E = \frac{1}{N_b} \sum_{i=1}^{N_b}
\|\tfrac{1}{2}(\mathsf{F}_i^T \mathsf{F}_i - I)\|
\end{equation}
where $\mathsf{F}_i$ is an 
approximate deformation gradient at particle $i$.
The argument inside the Frobenius norm $\| \cdot \|$
is the Green-Lagrange strain tensor.
The motivation for  \eqref{eq:SP} is as follows.
For relatively weak background flow strengths, the near-equilibrium particle
configurations behave as an elastic solid.  There is a map $\ff(\xx,t)$
from the reference (equilibrium) configuration with $\ff(\aa_i(0),t) = \aa_i(t)$
for $i = 1,\dots,N_b$.  Using linear approximation,
\[
\aa_j(t) - \aa_i(t) = \ff(\aa_j(0),t) - \ff(\aa_i(0),t)
\approx \nabla \ff(\aa_i(0),t)(\aa_j(0) - \aa_i(0)).
\]
To approximate
the deformation gradient $\nabla \ff(\aa_i(0),t)$
we solved the overdetermined system 
\[
\aa_j(t) - \aa_i(t) = \mathsf{F}_i(\aa_j(0) - \aa_i(0)),\quad j = 1,\dots, N_b  
\]
for $\mathsf{F}_i$ by weighted least squares. The weights  
$w_i = \exp(-\|\aa_j(0) - \aa_i(0)\|/4c)$ with particle radius $c$
ensure that nearby particles contribute the most to the linear approximation at $\aa_i$. 

Finally, we use the scalar order parameter for orientational order:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:S2}
S_2 = \frac{1}{N_b} \sum_{i=1}^{N_b} \frac{1}{2}(3\cos^2(\theta_i - \bar \theta) - 1).
\end{equation}
Here $\bar \theta$ is a circular mean defined as the
orientation of the largest eigenvalue eigenvector of 
$\dd_1\dd_1^\top + \dots + \dd_{N_b}\dd_{N_b}^\top$.
A value $S_2(t) = 1$ indicates 
that all particle directors lie on a common axis e.g.,
two parallel vectors with possibly opposite direction are ordered. 
A value far from 1 indicates disorder.

We must modify $S_2$ to account for the bilayer and
multilamellar structures.  In these cases, the directors 
are more or less bilayer uniformly distributed along a circle, even though
there is orientational order between neighboring particles.
To account for local order, we instead use
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:localS2}
\tilde{S}_2(t) = \frac{1}{N_b} \sum_{i=1}^{N_b}
\frac{1}{2}(3\cos^2(\theta_i - \bar \theta_i) - 1).
\end{equation}
where $\bar \theta_i$ is the circular mean restricted to particles
indexed by $j$ for which $\|\aa_i - \aa_j\| < 4c$. In practice, if a particle is
isolated and has no neighbors within a distance $4c$, then we exclude it from
the sum \eqref{eq:localS2}. 

Figure~\ref{fig:relax_energy}(b) 
tracks the orientational order parameter $\tilde{S}_2$.
Both bilayer and multilamellar
structures show similar trends in the small and large particle number systems
(Figure \ref{fig:relax}(b) black curves, red curves respectively).
The multilamellar structures are highly ordered in all cases (Figure~\ref{fig:relax}(c))
whereas the bilayer structures
are disordered because they consist of several connected
components forming isolated bilayers, micelles, and vesicles (Figure~\ref{fig:relax}(b)).


The aggregation for striated configurations form more than one 
pattern when the number of particles is varied (Figure~\ref{fig:relax}(d)).
We observe that when the number of particles is fewer, there is only
a single alternating pattern in particle orientations where the directors
are more or less parallel and alternate directions between stria (Figure~\ref{fig:relax}(d), inset).
Larger number of particles results in two different patterns: the alternating sign pattern
as in the small particle number case (Figure~\ref{fig:relax}(d), 
top right rectangle) and one where the directors reflect across the lines parallel
to the stria and across the lines perpendicular to the stria (Figure~\ref{fig:relax}(d),
top middle rectangle).
As a result, there are different trends in orientational order
(Figure~\ref{fig:relax_energy}(b), solid and dashed blue curves, respectively).


In the Results section,
the equilibrium configurations for cases (i), (ii), and (iii)
(Figure~\ref{fig:relax}, insets) are
used as initial data in the
background flow simulations. 
For the bilayer case (i), we include an alternate initial condition 
consisting of a single, circular vesicle (c.f., Figure~\ref{fig:Ves_shear}).

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}
In this section, we subject the Janus particle structures to various background
flows.  The purpose of this study is to understand how self-assembled particles
respond to external fluid forcing.  We can then compare the results to guage
the effective properties of materials comprised of Janus particles as a function
of their amphiphilic properties.

\subsection{Bilayer configurations in a shear flow}
To begin, we place the bilayer structure (Figure~\ref{fig:relax}(b), inset)
in the shear background flow
\begin{equation}
\uu_\infty(\xx) = \dot\gamma \text{ ns }^{-1} ({\bf e}_y\cdot\xx){\bf e}_x,
\end{equation}
%
where $\dot\gamma$ is the dimensionless shear rate and ${\bf e}_x$ and ${\bf e}_y$
are horizontal and vertical unit vectors, respectively.  
Figure~\ref{fig:BC1_shear}(a)--(c)
shows snapshots of the vesicle when $\dot\gamma= 0.05,0.075,0.01$
at $t = 0.5$ $\upmu$s.
The general pattern consists of a rotating body.  The various bilayer components
detach and reattach throughout so that the boyd is continuously changing morphology.
The supplementary movies show that these bilayers merge and form a worm-like shape in higher 
shear flows.

\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{Figures/Figure5.pdf}    
  \end{center}
  \vspace{-20pt}  
  \caption{\label{fig:BC1_TG} Multiple component bilayers in a Taylor-Green when $V_0 = \{0.1, 0.15, 0.2\}$ at $t=0.2\ \mu$s. The pre-relaxed initial configuration is shown in inset of panel (a). 
 The streamlines are plotted in the background. 
Panel (d) plots the free energies; panel (e) shows orientational parameter $\tilde{S}_2$; panel (f) shows positional parameter E.
  }
\end{figure}

In terms of deformations, 
the free energies 
are relatively constant (Figure~\ref{fig:BC1_shear}(d)),
with the overall changes in the range of a few kT/nm.  Note that the free energy takes
the form of a line tension because the simulations are two-dimensional.

An interesting feature of the simulations is that the $\tilde S_2$ order parameter
is on the average increasing (Figure~\ref{fig:BC1_shear}(e)).  In the initial configuration,
the structure has three or four components.  Under the shear flow, the detachment and reattachment
results in an overall decrease in the number of components.  This suggests that
the shear flow perturbs the local equilibrium obtained from a random initial condition
to an alternate local equilibrium with greater orientational order.

  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{Figures/Figure6.pdf}        
  \end{center}
\caption{\label{fig:ves_TG} Single vesicle in a TG flow. Panels (a)-(c) are snapshots for $V_0=\{0.1, 0.15, 0.2\}$ at $t=0.6\ \mu$s where the pre-relaxed initial configuration is shown in inset of panel (a). The streamlines are plotted in the background.
Panel (d) plots the free energies; panel (e) shows orientational parameter $\tilde{S}_2$; panel (f) shows positional parameter E.
}
\end{figure}


Finally, the strain parameter diverges in the large shear flow rate cases (Figure~\ref{fig:BC1_shear}(f))
because the components eventually completely separate and move away from one another
under the shear flow.

We reinitialized the case (i) configuration with particles arranged in the pattern of a single, circular vesicle.
This shape is also a local equilibrium, with somewhat less energy than the disordered state c.f.,
Figure~\ref{fig:BC1_shear}(d) and Figure~\ref{fig:Ves_shear} (d).
Our previous paper \cite{Fu2022_JFM} studied
The vesicle in a shear flow undergoes the familiar tank-treading deformation (Figure~\ref{fig:Ves_shear} (a)--(c)),
and based on previous results (\cite{Fu2022_JFM}),
we investigate the cases $\dot\gamma=0.05, 0.066, 0.075$.

Unlike the multiples component case, 
the energies for the vesicle case show jumps from the baseline value $30$ kT/nm to 32 kT/nm
signaling the rupture of the vesicle into multiple components
(Figure \ref{fig:Ves_shear}(d), long and short dashed curves).
After this initial break, the energies are more or less constant.



For the lowest shear rate case, the vesicle has nearly constant orientational order $\tilde S_2 = 1$
(Figure \ref{fig:Ves_shear}(e), solid curve).
Following rupture ($\dot\gamma= 0.066$ and $\dot \gamma= 0.075$),
there is greater variation in the order parameter $\tilde{S}_2$
with a baseline value around $0.7$
(Figure \ref{fig:Ves_shear}(e), dashed curves).
The oscillations occur due to the orbit of the two bilayer components,
and $\tilde{S}_2$ increases to about $0.9$ when the components slide past one another and are nearly parallel.

Like with multiple component bilayer case, positional order diverges when the components of the ruptured
vesicle separate and drift off in opposite directions (Figure \ref{fig:Ves_shear}(f), dashed curves).


%%%%%%%
\subsection{Bilayer and vesicle configurations in a Taylor-Green flow}
Next, we subject the bilayer/vesicles configurations to a 
Taylor-Green (TG) background flow
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:tg_flow}
\uu_\infty(\xx) = V_0\; \frac{\text{nm}}{\text{ns}}\;
\left(
-\cos\left(\frac{{\bf e}_x\cdot\xx}{\lambda}\right)
 \sin\left(\frac{{\bf e}_y\cdot\xx}{\lambda}\right)
         {\bf e}_x
         +\sin\left(\frac{{\bf e}_x\cdot\xx}{\lambda}\right)
         \cos\left(\frac{{\bf e}_y\cdot\xx}{\lambda}\right)
             {\bf e}_y\right).
\end{equation}
The TG flow is a confining flow consisting of a checkboard pattern
of cells with alternating circulation.  We control the flow by the
the dimensionless flow strength $V_0$ and with the cell size $\lambda = l$ nm.
The default parameter $l=2$ is used through this work.
%



There is no appreciable pattern in the deformation for the multicomponent bilayer case in TG flow. 
Figure~\ref{fig:BC1_TG}(a)--(c) are the snapshots when $V_0=0.1,0.15,0.2$ at $t = 0.2$ $\upmu$s.
At all flow strengths, the bilayer components are separated and mixed by the flow in neighboring cells. 
In the $V_0 = 0.2$ case, the flow breaks off components consisting of only a few particles,
leading an increase in energy (Figure~\ref{fig:BC1_TG}(d), long dashed curve).
There is no significant change in the orientational order.  There is an initial increase in the
strain parameter due to component mixing, but the strains remains bounded since the particles
stay confined to within the neighbors of the central cell.  


Patterns in the deformation, however, do emerge in the case of a vesicle in TG flow.
For a vesicle in a Taylor-Green flow, Figure~\ref{fig:ves_TG}(a)--(c) are configurations at $t=0.2\  \mu$s where $V_0=0.1,0.15,0.2$.
Here, the circular vesicle takes on a steady square shape for moderate flow rates $V_0 = 0.1$ and $V_0 = 0.15$.
In these cases, there is little change in the vesicle free energy and order (Figure~\ref{fig:ves_TG}(d)-(f))).
The vesicle disintegrates for $V_0 = 0.2$, leading to a jump in energy, drop in order, and increase in strain,
suggesting that the vesicle has a critical TG flow strength in the interval $[0.15, 0.2]$ separating the
intact and ruptured end-states.

\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{Figures/Figure7.pdf}
  \end{center}
  \vspace{-20pt}  
  \caption{\label{fig:BTG_Scale} With $V_0=0.1$, panels (a)-(d) show the configurations with streamlines when a vesicle is in Taylor-Green flow at $t=1 \mu$s and $l= 1,2,3,4$, respectively.
  For panel (e), the enclosed area $A_0/A$ calculated from the bilayer midplane decreases over time and the total length (as shown in the inset) measured from the midplane remains nearly constant with small magnitude of oscillations.
  }
\end{figure}

The vesicle shape is also tied to cell size $l$.  
Figure~\ref{fig:BTG_Scale}(a)--(d) show the deformation of a vesicle in a
TG flow for $V_0=0.1$ when $t = 1$ $\upmu$s.  
For the smallest cell size $l = 1$ tested, the vesicle is somewhat octogonal
and passes through multiple cells (Figure~\ref{fig:BTG_Scale}(a)).
For the largest cell size $l = 4$,
the vesicle is rhomboid and surrounds a single cell. 

In all cases, the vesicle tank-treads like in the shear flow case.
The direction of the tank-treading, however, varies with the cell
size (Figure~\ref{fig:BTG_Scale}(a)--(d), directed arcs).  We attribute
this variation to the total rotational moment of the cells that the vesicle
passes through.

We calculated the vesicle area $A$ and length $L$ (initial area $A_0$, initial length $L_0$)
by averaging the area/length for the inner and outer leaflets.  
As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:BTG_Scale}(e),
the relative area $A/A_0$ decreases during the simulations, with a rate
depending nonmonotonically on $l$.  
The relative length $L/L_0$, is constant in $t$ for all cell sizes (Figure~\ref{fig:BTG_Scale}(e), inset).
This implies that the vesicle behaves as an inextensible, permeable membrane.
In previous work, \cite{Fu2022_JFM} determined the permeability constant of particle-based vesicles
in the context of shear background flow.

\subsection{Multilamellar and striated configurations in shear and TG flow}
We have simulated particles for the multilamellar (case (ii)) and striated (case (iii))
boundary conditions, in both shear and TG background flow.  The results are
qualitatively similar and will be presented in tandem. 
For the multilamellar case, we place a 60-particle configuration (inset of Figure~\ref{fig:BC2_shear}(a))
in shear flows with $\dot\gamma=0.05, 0.1, 0.15$ and in TG flow with flow rates $V_0=0.1, 0.15, 0.2$.
For the striated case, we also place a 60-particle configuration (inset of Figure~\ref{fig:BC3_shear}(a))
in shear and TG background flows.  However, somewhat larger rates are required to see appreciable
deformations for this boundary condition: $\dot\gamma=0.1, 0.125, 0.15$
and $V_0=0.2, 0.25, 0.3$ respectively.  

In terms of shear flow, the free energies are steady at the lowest shear flow
rates (Figure~\ref{fig:BC2_shear}(d), Figure~\ref{fig:BC3_shear}(d)).
The free energy of the striated configuration oscillates by $\pm 1$ kT/nm
due to square reference region deforming into a rhomboidal shapre under shear
flow (Figure~\ref{fig:BC3_shear}(d), solid curve).  No such oscillation
is present in for the multilamellar configuration since this shape is circularly
isotropic (Figure~\ref{fig:BC2_shear}(d), solid curve).
At the lowest shear rates, there is, however, oscillation in the strains
of both configurations, 
while the order parameter $\tilde S_2$ is more less constant
(Figure~\ref{fig:BC2_shear}(e),(f), Figure~\ref{fig:BC3_shear}(e),(f), solid curves).
In summary, both multilallar and striated configurations behave as rigid bodies
under shear flow.

In the high shear flow rate cases ($\dot\gamma=0.15$), both the
multilamellar and striated configurations become disordered.  In case (ii),
the lamella break apart so that individual bilayers are no longer discernable
(Figure~\ref{fig:BC2_shear}(c)).
In case (iii), the stria detach from the main body,
but the stria remain instact (Figure~\ref{fig:BC3_shear}(c)).  
Overall, the particles in case (ii) and case (iii) remain bounded
and do not drift away in the shear background flow like for the
case (i) boundary condition (Figure~\ref{fig:BC1_shear}(c),
Figure~\ref{fig:Ves_shear}(c)).

Panel (d) plots the free energies; panel (e) shows orientational parameter $\tilde{S}_2$; panel (f) shows positional parameter E.
 }
\end{figure}


Under a TG background flow, the free energy $F$ 
is also basically constant for the lowest flow rates $V_0$
(Figure~\ref{fig:BC2_TG}(d), Figure~\ref{fig:BC3_TG}(d), solid curves).
The striated configuration is unperturbed by the flow, and is engulfed by a single,
larger, rotating flow cell
(Figure~\ref{fig:BC3_TG}(a)). 
The multilamellar configuration is perturbed by the flow, as seen in the increase in
the strain parameter $E$ (Figure~\ref{fig:BC3_TG}(f), solid curve).
The difference in response to the background flow
suggests that the multilamellar configuration
allows for local rearrangment of the particles while retaining the overall shape.

At large flow rates $V_0$, both configurations depart significantly from their local
equilibrium.  The lamella bilayers from case (ii) break apart, forming several,
unlayered bilayer components (Figure~\ref{fig:BC2_TG}(c)).

In case (iii), the stria also break apart, but neighboring particles form
'X'-like arrangements (Figure~\ref{fig:BC3_TG}(d)), resembling the doubly alternating
director equilibrium (Figure~\ref{fig:relax}(d), center, top white rectangle).

\section{Discussion}

Comparing with bilayer structures, Figure~\ref{fig:BC2_shear}(a)--(c) demonstrate that the multilamellar ones are more rigid in shear flow and the rupture phenomenon can be observed 
when the shear rate is high enough.

For multilamellar structure in a Taylor-Green flow, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:BC2_TG}(a)--(b), lower flow strengths such as $V_0=0.1,0.15$ do not reach a critical flow rate for structural disorder. 
When $V_0=0.2$ (Figure~\ref{fig:BC2_TG}(c)), the flow is strong enough to separate the structure
into multiple groups within the cells. In all deformation measures, a similar trend in shear flow case is observed, see Figure~\ref{fig:BC2_TG}(d)--(f). 


For a striated configuration in a Taylor-Green flow, numerical experiments have shown that one needs to choose relative higher flow strengths than other boundary conditions to reach structural disorder. Figure~\ref{fig:BC3_TG}(a)--(c) are configurations for $V_0=0.2, 0.25, 0.3$ at $t=0.4\  \mu$s.
Figure~\ref{fig:BC3_TG}(d)--(f) show that the threshold for having clear rupture is between $V_0=0.2$ and $V_0=0.25$ and a huge jump in measures occurs soon after the flow is turned on.

We place the striated configuration in a shear flow when $\dot\gamma=0.1, 0.125, 0.15$ and 
the snapshots at $t=0.1\ \mu$s are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:BC3_shear}(a)--(c).
Break-up deformation measures (igure~\ref{fig:BC3_shear}(d)--(f)) are similar to vesicle in shear flow case. Notably, for low shear rates, oscillatory behaviours are investigated in energies, orientational and positional parameters. 



It is worth noting that in the dipolar molecules modeled by
Laplace equation, the equilibrium configurations consist of strands,
rather than a patch, of particles and also have
alternating orientations \cite{}. 


We notice that the strain parameter are relatively higher (of order 10) in shear flows or not confining flows comparing with ones of order 1 in cases using Taylor-Green flows when rupture occurs. In order to make the structure disorder, the striated structures need the highest flow strength or shear rate in all three boundary conditions. Moreover, this can be interpreted by having higest free energy calculated from striated structures.


\section{Appendix}
\label{sec:appendix}
To prove \eqref{eq:normal_deriv}, let 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:SLP}
  \mathcal{S}[\sigma](\xx) = \int_\Gamma G(\xx-\yy) \sigma(\yy)\, \dif s_\yy
\end{equation}
be the single layer potential for a density function $\sigma.$
Fix $\xx \in \Gamma$,
let $\nnu_{\xx} = \nnu(\xx)$ and $\nnu_{\yy}$ be the unit normal at $\xx$, respectively $\yy$, in $\Gamma$,
and let $\zz \in \Omega$.  The subscripts in $\nabla_{\zz}$ and $\nabla_{\yy}$ denote
differentiation with respect to $\zz$, respectively $\yy$.

Recall from \eqref{eq:SL_BIE} that $u = \mathcal{D}[\sigma]$.
Then  
\begin{align*}
\nabla_{\zz} u(\zz) \cdot \nnu_{\xx}
&=\nnu_\xx \cdot \nabla_\zz \int_\Gamma \frac{\partial G(\zz-\yy)}{\partial \nnu_\yy}\sigma(\yy) \,\dif s_\yy\\
&=\int_\Gamma \nnu_\xx^\top \left(\nabla_\zz\nabla_\yy^\top  G(\zz-\yy)\right) \nnu_\yy\sigma(\yy)  \,\dif s_\yy\\
  &=-\int_\Gamma \nnu_\xx^\top \left(\nabla_\yy\nabla_\yy^\top G(\zz-\yy)\right)\nnu_\yy\sigma(\yy)\ \dif s_\yy,
\end{align*}
since we can interchange $\nabla_\zz$ with $-\nabla_\yy$.
Following \cite{Hsiao2008}, \S 1.2,
\[
\nnu_\xx^\top \left(\nabla_\yy\nabla_\yy^\top G(\zz-\yy)\right)\nnu_\yy
=
-\tt_{\xx}^\top \left(\nabla_\yy\nabla_\yy^\top G(\zz-\yy)\right)\tt_{\yy}
+ \Delta_{\yy}G(\zz-\yy) \tt_{\xx}\cdot \tt_{\yy}
\]
Then, using that $\Delta_{\yy} G(\zz-\yy) = \rho^{-2} G(\zz-\yy)$,
interchanging $\nabla_\yy$ with $-\nabla_\zz$ once more,
and integrating by parts in arclength $s$,
we obtain 
\begin{align*}
\nabla_{\zz} u(\zz) \cdot \nnu_{\xx}
&=-\int_\Gamma  \Delta_\yy G(\zz-\yy) {\bf t}_\xx \cdot   {\bf t}_\yy \sigma(\yy)\ \dif s_\yy
+\int_\Gamma({\bf t}_\xx\cdot\nabla_\yy)({\bf t}_\yy\cdot\nabla_\yy G(\zz-\yy))\sigma(\yy)\ \dif s_\yy\\
&= -\int_\Gamma \frac{1}{\rho^{2}} G(\zz-\yy) {\bf t}_\xx \cdot {\bf t}_\yy \sigma(\yy)\ \dif s_\yy  
-({\bf t}_\xx\cdot\nabla_\zz)\int_\Gamma \frac{\dif}{\dif s_\yy}G(\zz-\yy) \sigma(\yy)\ \dif s_\yy\\
&= -\frac{1}{\rho^2} {\bf t}_\xx\cdot \int_\Gamma G(\zz-\yy){\bf t}_\yy \sigma(\yy)\ \dif s_\yy + 
({\bf t}_\xx \cdot \nabla_\zz)\int_\Gamma G(\zz-\yy)\frac{\dif }{\dif s} \sigma(\yy)  \dif s_\yy.
\end{align*}
%
Letting $\zz\to\xx\in\Gamma$, and noting that both sides of the equation are continuous,
we obtain \eqref{eq:normal_deriv}.

\section{Governing Equations}
We consider a suspension of $N_b$ Janus particles in the fluid domain
$\Omega$. The boundary of the $\Omega$ is $\bd\Omega = \Gamma_1 \cup
\cdots \cup \Gamma_{N_b}$, where $\Gamma_i$ is the boundary of Janus
particle $i$. We also consider a bounded fluid domain where $\Gamma_0$
is the fixed boundary of $\Omega$. In this case, $\bd\Omega = \Gamma_0
\cup \Gamma_1 \cup \cdots \cup \Gamma_{N_b}$.

\subsection{Hydrophobic Attraction Potential Mobility Problem} 
The mathematical formulation is a nonlinear system for the dynamics of a
collection of rigid Janus particles. For the sake of completeness, we
summarize the governing equations here, and a complete description is in
our previous work~\cite{Fu2022_JFM}. The interactions satisfy a
system of partial differential equations (PDEs) that describe the
hydrodynamic interactions and hydrophobic interactions. Assuming
inertial terms are negligible, the solvent is goverened by the Stokes
equations
\begin{alignat}{3}

  -\mu \Delta \uu + \nabla p &= \mathbf{0},     && \xx \in \Omega, \\
  \nabla\cdot \uu &= 0, \qquad && \xx \in \Omega, \\
  \uu - \uu_\infty &\to \mathbf{0}, && |\xx| \to \infty,
\end{alignat}
where $\uu$ is the velocity, $p$ is the pressure, $\uu_\infty$ is the
background flow, and $\mu$ is the constant viscosity. The domain $\Omega
= \Omega(t)$ is the fluid region surrounding the particles and changes
shape as the particles move. Since the particles are rigid, the solvent
velocity satisfies the no-slip rigid body motion boundary condition
\begin{align}
  \vv_i + \omega_i (\xx - \aa_i)^\perp = \uu(\xx), 
    \quad \xx \in \Gamma_i,
\end{align}
where $\vv_i$ is the translational velocity and $\omega_i$ is the
angular velocity. Once these velocities are determined, we use
second-order Adams-Bashforth to update the particle configuration. 

The translational and angular velocities guarantee that the fluid forces
balanace the imposed forces. The imposed forces include the hydrophobic
interactions that arise so that particles minimize the free energy of
the structure of the surronding water molecules. The free energy
functional is
\begin{align}
\label{eq:free_energy}
  F[u] = C \int_{\Omega} \left(\rho |\nabla u|^2 + \rho^{-1} f(u)\right)
  \,d\xx,
\end{align}
where $u$ is an order parameter for the structure of water, $\rho$ is a
decay length, $C$ is a constant, and $f(u)$ is a potential.
%$c$ is ``effective" inter-particle distance below which the steric repulsion becomes important.
Hydrogen-bond persistence times are on the order of picoseconds which is
much smaller than characteristic time for particle motion.
%\cite{MaGa13}. 
Thus we assume $u$ minimizes $F[u]$ for all times. Assuming appropriate
conditions on $f(u)$,
% (\cite{evans10}, \S 8.2),
$u$ satisfies the Euler-Lagrange equation
\begin{alignat}{3}
  \label{eq:SL}
  -\rho^2 \Delta u + \tfrac{1}{2}f'(u) &= 0, && \xx \in \Omega, \\
  u &= g, && \xx \in \bd\Omega, \\
  u &\rightarrow 0, \qquad&& |\xx| \rightarrow \infty.
\end{alignat}
Equation~\eqref{eq:SL} is solved with a boundary integral equation
method. The boundary condition $g$ is a material label that is
transported with the particle.

The particles lower the free energy $F[u]$ of the surrounding water
by moving. We calculate the rate of change of $F[u]$ using
variation of the domain. % ~\cite{Fu2018_SIAM,Bandle2015, Schiffer1954, Grinfeld2010}.
Carrying out this variation yields the stress  
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:stress}
\mathbf{T}
= C \left[ \rho^{-1} f(u) \mathbf{I}
  + \rho \left(|\nabla u|^2 \mathbf{I} - 
  2\nabla u \nabla u^T\right)\right].
\end{align}
The imposed forces and torques come from the integration of $\mathbf{T}$
along the particle boundary. These forces and torques couple the Stokes
equations \eqref{eq:stokes}, to semilinear elliptic equation
\eqref{eq:SL}. Solving for the translational and rotational velocities
gives the particle evolution.

To solve the Stokes equation with the correct boundary conditions, we
represent the velocity as the of a layer potential with Stokeslets and
rotlets
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:velocity}
  \uu(\xx) = \uu_\infty(\xx) + \DD[\eeta](\xx) + 
    \sum_{i=1}^{N_b} \left(\SS(\xx,\aa_i) \cdot \FF_i + 
    \RR(\xx,\aa_i) T_i\right), \quad \xx \in \Omega.
\end{align}
%
Then, the density function $\eeta$, translation velocity $\vv_i$ and
angular velocity $\omega_i$ satisfy
\begin{alignat}{3}
  \nonumber
  \vv_i + \omega_i (\xx - \aa_i)^\perp &= \uu_\infty(\xx)
    -\frac{1}{2} \eeta(\xx) + \DD[\eeta](\xx) \\
  \label{eq:SKIE}
    + \sum_{j=1}^{N_b} &
    \left(\SS(\xx,\aa_j) \cdot \FF_j + \RR(\xx,\aa_j) T_j\right),
    \quad &&\xx \in \Gamma_i,\: i=1,\ldots,N_b, \\
  \label{eq:mobility1}
  \int_{\Gamma_i} \eeta \, \dif s &= \mathbf{F}_i, 
  &&i = 1,\ldots,N_b, \\
  \label{eq:mobility2}
  \int_{\Gamma_i} \eeta \cdot (\xx-\aa_i)^\perp \, \dif s &= T_i,
  &&i = 1,\ldots,N_b.
\end{alignat}

\subsection{Normal Derivative of Double Layer Potential and HAP Energy}

We adopt the double layer potential to express the solution of \eqref{eq:SL} where the condition is $f(u)=u^2$. Then it is given by 
\begin{align}
\label{eq:energy_BIE}
u({\bf x}) = \DD[\sigma](\xx) = \int_\Gamma \frac{\partial G(\xx-\yy)}{\partial \nnu_\yy}\sigma(\yy)\, \dif s_\yy,
\end{align}
%
where $G(\xx)$ is the fundamental solution to the screened Laplace equation \eqref{eq:SL} and $\nnu$ is the outward normal.
Since the free energy functional can be written as 
\begin{align}
\label{eq:free_energy2}
  E[u(\xx)] &= C\rho \int_\Gamma u \frac{\partial u}{\partial \nnu}  \,\dif s, \quad \xx\in\Gamma_i,
\end{align}
%
we can then refer to the identity (\cite{Hsiao2008}, \S 1.2) to calculate this boundary integral equation without evaluating the normal derivative of the double layer potential directly.

Consider
\begin{align}
\nnu_\xx \cdot \nabla_\zz u(\zz) &=\nnu_\xx \cdot \nabla_\zz \int_\Gamma \frac{\partial G(\zz-\yy)}{\partial \nnu_\yy}\sigma(\yy) \,\dif s_\yy\\
&=\int_\Gamma \nnu_\xx\cdot \left(\nabla_\zz\nabla_\yy^\top  G(\zz-\yy)\right)\cdot \nnu_\yy\sigma(\yy)  \,\dif s_\yy\\
&=-\int_\Gamma \nnu_\xx\cdot \left(\nabla_\yy\nabla_\yy^\top G(\zz-\yy)\right)\cdot\nnu_\yy\sigma(\yy)\ \dif s_\yy\\
&=-\int_\Gamma {\bf t}_\xx\cdot\Delta_\yy G(\zz-\yy) {\bf t}_\yy \sigma(\yy)\ \dif s_\yy+\int_\Gamma({\bf t}_\xx\cdot\nabla_\yy)({\bf t}_\yy\cdot\nabla_\yy G(\zz-\yy))\sigma(\yy)\ \dif s_\yy\\
&= -\int_\Gamma {\bf t}_\xx\cdot\frac1\rho^2 G(\zz-\yy) {\bf t}_\yy \sigma(\yy)\ \dif s_\yy - 
({\bf t}_\xx\cdot\nabla_\zz)\int_\Gamma \frac{\partial G(\zz-\yy)}{\partial s_\yy}\sigma(\yy)\ \dif s_\yy\\
&= -\frac1\rho^2 {\bf t}_\xx\cdot \int_\Gamma G(\zz-\yy){\bf t}_\yy \sigma(\yy)\ \dif s_\yy + 
({\bf t}_\xx \cdot \nabla_\zz)\int_\Gamma G(\zz-\yy)\frac{\partial \sigma(\yy)}{\partial s}\ \dif s_\yy.
\end{align}
%
Here ${\bf t}_\xx$ is the tangent vector at the point $\xx$ and $d/ds$ is the arclength derivative.
Letting $\zz\to\xx\in\Gamma$, we obtain
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:normal_deriv}
\frac{\partial}{\partial \nnu_\xx} \DD[\sigma](\xx) = -\frac1\rho^2 {\bf t}_\xx\cdot \SSS[\sigma{\bf t}](\xx) + \frac{\partial}{\partial s}\SSS\left[\frac{\partial \sigma}{\partial s}\right](\xx).
\end{equation}
%

Substituting \eqref{eq:normal_deriv} to \eqref{eq:free_energy2} provides the total energy calculation
throughout this paper and this expression takes the advantage of not calculating the quadruple layer potential which has well-known obstacle in numerical implementation.

%Suppose we split the solution to the screened Laplace boundary value problem~\eqref{eq:SL}
%into smooth portion $w_i$ and singular portion $u_i$. That is, 
%\begin{equation}
%w_i({\bf x}) = u({\bf x}) - u_i = u({\bf x}) - \int_{\Gamma_i }\left(\pderiv{}{\nnu_\yy}
%    K_0 \left(\frac{|\xx - \yy|}{\rho}\right)\right) \sigma_i(\yy) \,
%    \dif s_\yy, \quad \xx \in \Gamma_i.
%\end{equation}
%Consider the case when $f(u)=u^2$ in~\eqref{eq:free_energy}, we can rewrite the free energy functional as 
%
%\begin{align}
%\label{eq:free_energy2}
%  E[u(\xx)] &= C\rho \sum_{i=1}^{N_b}\int_{\Gamma_i} u \frac{\partial u}{\partial \nnu}  \,\dif s

%\end{align}
%%%%
%Follow the divergence theorem on the last term in the equation above and denote $g_i(x)$ as the boundary data on $\Gamma_i$, we obtain
%\begin{align}
%\label{eq:free_energy3}
%  E[u(\xx)] &= C\rho\sum_{i=1}^{N_b}\left(\int_{\Gamma_i} u \frac{\partial w_i}{\partial \nnu} \,\dif s  + \int_{\mathbb{R}^n\setminus \overline{U}_i} \left( \nabla u \cdot\nabla u_i + u\Delta u_i\right) \,\dif \xx\right)\\

\section{Numerical Results}

\subsection{Self-Assembled Janus Particle with Specific Boundary Conditions}

Distinct morphologies can be obtained from 
the HAP model by shifting the boundary condition $g(\xx)$.
Consider the linear case where $f(u) = u^2$.
This choice makes \eqref{eq:SL} a boundary value
problem for the screened-Laplace equation
and the solutions have a boundary layer structure that decays to $0$ in the
bulk with the decay length $\rho$.
We consider three kinds of boundary conditions
on particle $\Gamma_i$:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:bcs}
  \begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
     \text{(i)} & \text{(ii)} & \text{(iii)} \\
    \hline
    \rule{0pt}{4ex} 
      $g(\mathbf{x}) = \displaystyle \frac{1+\cos (\theta_i(\xx))}{\sqrt{3\pi r}}$
    & $g(\mathbf{x}) = \displaystyle \frac{2+\cos (\theta_i(\xx))}{\sqrt{9\pi r}}$
    & $g(\mathbf{x}) = \displaystyle \frac{\cos (\theta_i(\xx))}{\sqrt{\pi r}}$
\end{tabular}
\end{equation}
The number $\theta_i(\xx)$ is the angle formed by the position $\xx$,
the particle center $\aa_i$, and the particle director $\dd_i$.% (Figure
\ref{fig:flow_map}).
The normalizations e.g., $(\pi r)^{-1/2}$, provide a uniform surface
energy $\int_{\Gamma_i} g^2 \,ds = 1$ for circular particles of radius
$r$. The cases (ii) and (iii) are obtained by applying a vertical shift
and scaling to case (i).  Using this setup, we simulate the dynamics of
60 particles with one set of random initial positions and orientations
as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:relax}(a)

\end{figure}

Case (i) models amphiphilic particles.
Amphiphilic particles have a hydrophobic tail and a hydrophilic head
and these are accounted for as follows.
The hydrophilic side takes the value $u =0$.
This mimicks the apolar head of a lipid, for example, which does
not alter the structure of adjacent waters. The hydrophobic side
represents hydrocarbons and takes the value 
$u > 0$. The interaction between particles is attractive,
and particles will collectively orient their tails toward
one another. Figure~\ref{fig:relax}(b) demonstrates multiple bilayer structures such as pancake and vesicle shapes.


Multilamelar bilayers arise when both sides of the particle 
are hydrophobic. 
The boundary condition \eqref{eq:bcs}(ii) 
gives a particle with a hydrophobic intensity that is greater
on the $\theta_i = 0$ side than on the $\theta_i = \pi$ side.
The initial self-assembly is similar to that in case (i).
The difference arises in the long-time dynamics where the bilayers
no longer remain well-separated. 
Rather, the bilayers form layers 
as a consequence of the interfacial tension of exposed particle
heads.%~\cite{Huetal19, deMeetal21}. 
Figure~\ref{fig:relax}(c) shows the multilamellar structure with 8 layers when $N_b=60$. 
The number of folds depends on several factors, for instances, number of particles and intial configurations.


Finally, boundary condition \eqref{eq:bcs}(iii) models 
a particle whose head surface repels the tail surface as proposed in
\cite{MaRa76, Ma77}.
The particles initially form chains with their directors perpendicular to the
length of the chain. The equilibrium structure
resembles a checkerboard pattern
where each particle coordinates
its head with the head of three other particles and its tail with the
tail of three other particles. % Figure~\ref{fig:self-assembly}(c).
Figure~\ref{fig:relax}(d) gives an example that this boundary condition results a checker board/stripes equilibrium state.


Figure~\ref{fig:relax_energy} shows the energy profile of boundary conditions (i)--(iii) using 
\eqref{eq:free_energy2} with \eqref{eq:normal_deriv} for normal derivative expression. As expected, for all simulation runs, the total energy of the systems decreases and reaches equilibrium states.



\subsection{Collective Janus Particles Suspended in a Shear Flow}
%%%


Consider placing the equilibrium state of boundary condition \eqref{eq:bcs} (ii) for 60 particles in a shear flow,
\begin{equation}
\uu_\infty(\xx) = \dot\gamma ({\bf e}_y\cdot\xx){\bf e}_x,
\end{equation}
%
where $\dot\gamma$ is the shear rate. Figure~\ref{fig:shear_1} (a)--(c) show the snapshots of simulation results when $\dot\gamma=0.05$.
We measure the ratio of major and minor axes $\lambda$ by adopting an ellipse fitting using the singular value decomposition and track this aspect ratio for this multi-lamellar structure when the flow is on. 
The result is shown in panel (d) and we observe that the multi-lamellar structure will be slightly stretched and the aspect ratio $\lambda=3.5$ increases over time.
%
Notice that for this simulation, the center of mass position of the
initial configuration is not at the origin and it is slightly to the
right of the origin. We also track the aspect ratio $\lambda$ for the
case that the center of mass position is shifted to the origin. Panel
(d) also shows that the dynamics of two sets of simulations are
invariant of center of mass position in a shear flow.

%Consider the energy profiles for two simulations where the centor of mass is on and off the origin.
%Figure~\ref{fig:shear_energy1} shows numerical results for both energy profiles and magnitude of energy differences is significantly large when there is a large deformation, for instance, the case when a multi-lamellar structure deformed to a pancake shape.

%%%

The second set of simulation is putting the equilibrium state of the boundary condition \eqref{eq:bcs} (iii), the checker board, in a shear flow. After a set of empirical numerical investigations, we obtain a critical shear rate $\dot\gamma=0.15$ where the checker board deforms into stripes and small groups of JP. Figure~\ref{fig:shear_2}(a)--(d) show configurations when $t=\{0,50,100,150\}$. %The deformation starts with stripe separations

\subsection{Collective Janus Particles Suspended in a Taylor-Green Flow}

Similar to shear flow simulations, we then place equilibrium states of all boundary conditions \eqref{eq:bcs} in a rotating Taylor-Green Flow with a length scale $l$,
\begin{equation}
\uu_\infty(\xx) = V_0 \left(-\cos(l{\bf e}_x\cdot\xx)\sin(l{\bf e}_y\cdot\xx){\bf e}_x+\sin(l{\bf e}_x\cdot\xx)\cos(l{\bf e}_y\cdot\xx){\bf e}_y\right).
\end{equation}
%
The magnitude of the vortex flow is controlled by the velocity scale $V_0$.
Similar to the setup in the shear flow cases, we shift the center of mass position to the origin then turn on the Taylor-Green flow with $V_0=0.1$ and tune the sides of zero-velocity box to $\pi$, i.e., $l=0.5$, Figure~\ref{fig:TG_1}(a)--(c) show three frames of simulation results and we 
track the aspect ratio $\lambda$ described in the previous section which is provided in panel (d). 
The stiffness of the multi-lamellar structure is able to compete with the flow therefore the structure
does not deform to any states other than multi-lamellar shape. 
We also found that the flow strength coefficient above $V_0=0.1$ will result to clear group separations during the simulations. 
Comparing with the case when $V_0=0.2$, we provide a frame in Figure~\ref{fig:TG_2}(a) and the energy comparison is shown in panel (b). Numerical results validate the phenomenon that a higher taylor green vortex flow generates large structure separations with higher total energy.

\subsection{Steady-State Structure Confined in Narrow Channels}


Here are demonstrations of having JP vesicle and multi-lamellar structure in a narrow channel 
under a shear flow.
Simulation results and snapshots are shown in Figures~\ref{fig:confined_vesicle} and Figure~\ref{fig:confined_lamellar} where the JP vesicle has $N_b=25$ particles and JP lamellar has $N_b=40$ particles, respectively. Both starting configurations are pre-relaxed and the channel width in the narrow part is about 5 length units in the vesicle case and 4 length units in the lamellar case.
