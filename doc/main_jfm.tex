  We develop a new model, to our knowledge,  for the many-body  hydrodynamics of amphiphilic 
  Janus particles suspended in a viscous background flow. 
  The Janus particles interact through a hydrophobic attraction potential 
  that leads to self-assembly into bilayer structures.   
  We adopt an efficient integral equation method for solving the screened
  Laplace equation for hydrophobic attraction and 
  for solving the mobility problem for hydrodynamic interactions. 
  The integral equation formulation accurately captures both interactions for near touched boundaries. 
  Under a linear shear flow,  we observe the tank-treading deformation
  in a two-dimensional vesicle made of Janus particles.
  The results yield measurements of inter-monolayer friction, membrane permeability, 
  and at large shear rates, membrane rupture. 
  The simulations studies include a Janus particle vesicle in both linear and parabolic shear flows,  and 
  interactions between two Janus particle vesicles in shear and extensional flows. The hydrodynamics of the Janus 
  particles vesicle is similar to the behaviour of an inextensible elastic vesicle membrane with permeability.

\section{\label{intro}Introduction}
Described by physicist Pierre-Gilles de Gennes as ``another animal in soft matter physics", the
Janus particle--often a spherical particle with a hydrophobic and a
hydrophilic hemisphere--exhibits complex aggregate, clustering, and
self-assembly into mesoscopic and macroscopic structures that are
relevant to a wide range of applications in biology and bioengineering (\cite{deGennes1991}).
Whether it is surface chemistry or polarity under an external field, the
dynamics of Janus particles in a viscous solvent is inevitably the combination of long-range
hydrodynamics interactions with both short- and intermediate-range 
particle-particle interactions. Such multi-scale nature of Janus particle dynamics underlies 
the richness of a Janus particle suspension, as \cite{deGennes1991} suggested by the example of 
a ``thin film of Janus grains" that can breathe due to the interstices between Janus particles.

\end{figure}

Recently,~\cite{Fu20} illustrated that the hydrophobic interactions
between Janus particles (JP) in a viscous solvent can be used as a
coarse-grained model to capture the mechanics of an elastic bilayer
membrane of amphiphilic macromolecules such as lipids. Depending on
their total number and geometry, JP suspensions can aggregate to form a
micelle, a patch of bilayer membrane with open ends, and a self-enclosed
bilayer membrane, referred to as a JP vesicle. Using a hybrid continuum
model for the interactions between amphiphilic particles in a viscous
solvent and with a boundary integral formulation,~\cite{Fu20} showed
that the granularity of membrane remodeling, as occurs during fusion and
fission of bilayers, can be accurately captured by the coarse-grained
model.  
%This boundary integral formulation has inspired more recent work

In the present work, we extend the hybrid continuum model in~\cite{Fu20}
for the Janus suspension to incorporate the collective hydrodynamics of
a Janus suspension under various flows. The JP vesicles in our
simulations replicate  \ReviewerOne{well-known} vesicle hydrodynamics
such as tank-treading and inter-leaflet slippage in a shear flow and
migration in Poiseuille flow from continuum models. Furthermore we use
the hybrid continuum model to investigate permeability and rupture of a
bilayer membrane due to an imposed flow.  Finally, we compare a pair of
interacting JP vesicles with a continuum model of a pair of vesicles.

%\cite{Brandner2019} used the coarse-grained force field with a lattice
%Boltzmann molecular dynamics to simulate the hydrodynamics of a
%nano-sized vesicle under a shear flow.  In MD simulations, the
%hydrodynamic interactions for the solvent phase are often approximated
%by an implicit solvent coarse-grained model.  In the present work, the
%hydrodynamic interactions come from the mobility problem for the Stokes
%equations for the incompressible, viscous solvent.  

To simulate the hydrodynamics of Janus particles in Stokes flow,
we require a numerical method to avoid unphysical contact between rigid
Janus particles. Optimization-based contact methods introduce
constraints, such as enforcing a non-positive space-time interference
volume (\cite{lu-rah-zor2017, Lukas19, yan-cor-mal-vee-she2020}). These
methods do not introduce stiffness, but do require solving potentially
expensive nonlinear complementarity problems at each time step.
Repulsion-based contact methods, which we employ, introduce an
artificial repulsion force that increases in strength as two particles
approach one another (\cite{glo-pan-hes-jos-per2001, fen-mic2004,
kab-qua-bir2018}). Strong repulsion forces can introduce numerical
stiffness, but with the presence of the hydrophobic forces, we maintain
contact-free suspensions with a relatively \textcolor{red}{soft} repulsive
force \textcolor{red}{(compared to the short-range repulsion that diverges in the Lennard-Jones potential)}.

The paper is organized as follows. In \S~\ref{sec:governing_eqs} we
present the formulation for the Janus particles in a viscous fluid in
the zero-Reynolds number regime (Figure \ref{fig:figure0}a). In
\S~\ref{sec:IEM} we extend the hybrid continuum model for a Janus
suspension to include the effects of a far-field flow via the mobility
problem formulation. In \S~\ref{results} we validate our model and
present simulation results for a single JP vesicle (Figure
\ref{fig:figure0}d) and for a pair of JP vesicles (Figure
\ref{fig:figure0}e) under various flowing conditions. Finally we provide
discussion and outlook for future directions in \S~\ref{conclusion}.

\section{Governing Equations\label{sec:governing_eqs}}
\subsection{\label{mobility}Mobility Problem}
The objective of this work is to study the hydrodynamics of JP vesicles
in background flows. We consider an $N_b$-many body collection of JP
suspended in a two-dimensional unbounded domain $\Omega$. The boundary
of each particle is denoted by $\Gamma_i$ so that $\bd \Omega = \Gamma_1
\cup \Gamma_2 \cup \cdots \cup \Gamma_{N_b}$ (Figure
\ref{fig:figure0}a). Assuming the inertial terms are negligible, the
governing equations are
\begin{alignat}{3}
\label{eq:stokes}
  -\mu \Delta \uu + \nabla p &= \mathbf{0}, 
    && \xx \in \Omega, \\
  \nabla\cdot \uu &= 0, \qquad && \xx \in \Omega, \\
  \uu - \uu_\infty &\to \mathbf{0}, && |\xx| \to \infty,
\end{alignat}
%
where $\uu$ is the velocity, $p$ is the
pressure, $\uu_\infty$ is the background flow, and $\mu$ is the constant viscosity. 
%
Since each particle $\Gamma_i$ with centre $\aa_i$ is a rigid body, its velocity satisfies 
\ReviewerOne{the no-slip boundary condition}
\begin{align}
\label{eq:rigid_bc}
  \ReviewerOne{\uu}(\xx) = \vv_i + \omega_i (\xx - \aa_i)^\perp, \quad 
    \xx \in \Gamma_i,
\end{align}
where $\vv_i$ is its translational velocity and $\omega_i$ is its
angular velocity. Here, $\langle x, y \rangle^{\perp} = \langle -y, x
\rangle$.
%Therefore, the no-slip boundary condition on each particle is
%
%
%\begin{align}
%\label{eq:rigid_bc}
%  \uu(\xx) = \vv_i + \omega_i (\xx - \aa_i)^\perp, \quad
%    \xx \in \Gamma_i.
%\end{align}
%
%
To determine the translational and angular velocities of each particle,
we define imposed forces $\FF_i$ and torques $T_i$ acting on each
particle. Since the small particles are inertialess, force and torque
balance gives 
\begin{alignat}{2}
  \label{eq:force}
  \FF_i &- \int_{\Gamma_i} \ssigma \cdot \nnu \, \dif s = \mathbf{0},
  && i=1,\ldots,N_b,\\
  \label{eq:torque}
  T_i &- \int_{\Gamma_i} (\xx - \aa_i)^\perp \cdot 
    (\ssigma \cdot \nnu) \, \dif s = 0, \qquad && i=1,\ldots,N_b,
\end{alignat}
where $\ssigma = -p \mathbf{I} + \mu \left(\nabla \uu + \nabla \uu^T
\right)$ is the hydrodynamic stress tensor (pressure tensor) and
$\nnu$ is the particle outward normal. The process of finding the
translational and angular velocities given the forces and torques is
referred to as the mobility problem.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Imposed Forces}
The imposed forces and torques contain two parts: hydrophobic attraction
and repulsion. The hydrophobic attraction potential was introduced
by~\cite{Fu20} and is responsible for forming particle aggregates that
sequester their hydrophobic surface regions (Figure \ref{fig:figure0}b).
We model hydrophobic attraction by solving the screened Laplace equation
boundary value problem
\begin{alignat}{2}
  \label{eq:SL}
-\rho^2 \Delta \ReviewerTwo{\eta} + \ReviewerTwo{\eta} &=0,            && \xx \in \Omega,\\
\label{eq:SLbc}
\ReviewerTwo{\eta}(\xx) &= f_i(\xx),\qquad  && \xx \in \Gamma_i,\; i=1,\ldots,N_b, \\
\label{eq:SLff}
\ReviewerTwo{\eta} &\to 0,                          &&|\xx| \to \infty,
\end{alignat}
where $0 \leq f_i \leq 1$ is a material label with $f_i = 0$,
respectively $1$, representing hydrophilic, respectively hydrophobic,
portions of the surface. We assume that both $f_i$ and $\Gamma_i$ are
smooth. The parameter $\rho > 0$ is the decay length of attraction. The
forces and torques of attraction are 
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:hydrophobicAttraction}
  \FF_i^{\text{hydro}} = \int_{\Gamma_i} {\bf T}\cdot \nnu \, \dif s, 
    \quad 
  T_i^{\text{hydro}} = \int_{\Gamma_i} (\xx - \aa_i)^{\perp} \cdot ({\bf T} \cdot \nnu) \dif s,
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:stress}
\mathbf{T}
= \gamma\rho^{-1}\ReviewerTwo{\eta}^2 \mathbf{I} + 2\rho\gamma \left(\tfrac{1}{2}|\nabla
  \ReviewerTwo{\eta}|^2 \mathbf{I} - \nabla \ReviewerTwo{\eta}  \nabla \ReviewerTwo{\eta}^T\right)
\end{align}
is the hydrophobic stress tensor and $\gamma > 0$ is
the interfacial
tension. 

The second part of the imposed forces and torques comes from repulsion
between proximal particles. Given a pair particles indexed with $i$ and
$j$, we find the two points $\tilde{\xx}_i \in \Gamma_i$ and
$\tilde{\xx}_j \in \Gamma_j$ that are closest to one another (Figure \ref{fig:figure0}a). We then
define the repulsion force and torque
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:REPULforce}
  \FF_i^{\text{repul}} &= \sum_{j \neq i} 
    \frac{\tilde{\xx}_i - \tilde{\xx}_j}
    {|\tilde{\xx}_i - \tilde{\xx}_j|} 
    P'(|\tilde{\xx}_i - \tilde{\xx}_j|), \\
  \label{eq:REPULtorque}
  T_i^{\text{repul}} &= \sum_{j \neq i} 
    (\tilde{\xx}_i - \aa_i)^{\perp} \cdot 
    \frac{\tilde{\xx}_i - \tilde{\xx}_j}
    {|\tilde{\xx}_i - \tilde{\xx}_j|} 
    P'(|\tilde{\xx}_i - \tilde{\xx}_j|).
\end{align}
The repulsion profile $P(r)$ is set to zero for distances $r$ larger than a
repulsion length scale $\rho_0$. As such,~\eqref{eq:REPULforce}
and~\eqref{eq:REPULtorque} ignore particles outside a
$\rho_0$-tubular neighborhood of $\Gamma_i$. For $0 \leq r < \rho_0,$ we use
$P(r) = M(1 - \sin(r/\rho_0))$.
Then, the total imposed force and torque
are
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:total_forces}
  \FF_i = \FF_i^{\text{hydro}} + \FF_i^{\text{repul}},\quad
  T_i = T_i^{\text{hydro}} + T_i^{\text{repul}}, \qquad
  i=1,\ldots,N_b.
\end{equation}

\ReviewerThree{
The high-order interpolation-based quadrature rule used to compute the nearly-singular integrals has
been shown to capture well the lubrication hydrodynamics in the narrow space between boundaries 
when the repulsive potential $P$ gives a large steric force \citep{qua-bir2014}.  
In the simulations we adjust the spatial resolution on the particle boundary to ensure that the lubrication hydrodynamics is well resolved as in \citep{qua-vee-you2019,qua-gan-you2021}.

%By solving the mobility problem, we obtain translational and angular
%velocities of the $N_b$-body system. 
%A second-order Adams-Bashforth
%scheme updates the particle positions and orientations. By including the
%repulsion force~\eqref{eq:REPULforce}, particle collisions are avoided even
%when using a relatively large time step. 



%This paper is organized as follows. Chapter 2 introduces the mobility problem..... The integral equation method for solving $N_b$-body system with details of .... are included in Chapter 3. We provide numerical results of vesicle simulations in Chapter 4. Finally, we conclude the work and briefly give the picture of our future work.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Integral Equation Method}
\label{sec:IEM}
Computing the hydrophobic attraction potential and the particle forces
and torques requires the solution of elliptic partial differential
equations (PDEs) in an unbounded complex domain. We recast both these
PDEs as boundary integral equations (BIEs). We discretize each BIE at
$N$ points on each of the $N_b$ particles with a collocation method.
\ReviewerOne{All derivatives are computed with spectrally-accurate
Fourier differentiation.} Integrals that are smooth are computed with
the spectrally-accurate trapezoid rule, and nearly-singular integrals,
caused by close contact between two particles, are computed with a
high-order interpolation-based quadrature rule (\cite{qua-bir2014}).
After discretizing and applying quadrature, the resulting linear system
is solved with matrix-free GMRES, and we guarantee that the number of
GMRES iterations is mesh-independent by using second-kind BIEs.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{HAP Boundary Integral Equation}
Similar to our previous work (\cite{Fu20}), we represent the
\ReviewerTwo{hydrophobic attraction potential (HAP)} as a double-layer
potential
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:HAP_DLP}
  \ReviewerTwo{\eta}(\xx) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{\bd\Omega} \left(\pderiv{}{\nnu_\yy}
    K_0 \left(\frac{|\xx - \yy|}{\rho}\right)\right) 
    \sigma(\yy) \, \dif s_\yy, \quad \xx \in \Omega,
\end{align}
where $K_0$ is the zeroth-order modified Bessel function of the first
kind and the integral is taken in the sense of principle value whenever
$\xx \in \partial \Omega$.  By requiring that the density function
$\sigma$ satisfies the second-kind integral equation
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:screenedSKIE}
  f(\xx) = \frac{1}{2}\sigma(\xx) + 
    \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{\bd\Omega} \left(\pderiv{}{\nnu_\yy}
    K_0 \left(\frac{|\xx - \yy|}{\rho}\right)\right) \sigma(\yy) \, 
    \dif s_\yy, \quad \xx \in \bd\Omega,
\end{equation}
the HAP double-layer potential~\eqref{eq:HAP_DLP} satisfies the screened
Laplace equation~\eqref{eq:SL}--\eqref{eq:SLff}. After
discretizing~\eqref{eq:screenedSKIE}, the result is an $NN_b \times
NN_b$ linear system that is solved with block-diagonal preconditioned
GMRES.

To calculate the hydrophobic force and torque, the gradient of the
double-layer potential~\eqref{eq:HAP_DLP} must be computed on the
boundary of each particle. The resulting integrands are singular, and
specialized quadrature would be necessary to approximate such integrals.
Alternatively, in Section~\ref{subsec:calculating_force}, we show how
the force and torque calculations can be expressed in terms of
non-singular integrals.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Mobility Problem Boundary Integral Equation}
Following previous work of~\cite{Lukas19}, we use the velocity
representation of~\cite{pow-mir1987}. In particular, we write the
velocity as the sum of a double-layer potential and $N_b$-many Stokeslets and
rotlets
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:velocity}
  \uu(\xx) = \uu_\infty(\xx) + \DD[\eeta](\xx) + 
    \sum_{i=1}^{N_b} \left(\SS(\xx,\aa_i) \cdot \FF_i + 
    \RR(\xx,\aa_i) T_i\right), \quad \xx \in \Omega.
\end{align}
The double-layer potential is
\begin{align}
  \DD[\eeta](\xx) = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_{\bd\Omega} 
    \frac{\rr \cdot \nnu}{|\rr|^2} \frac{\rr \otimes \rr}{|\rr|^2}
    \cdot \eeta(\yy) \, \dif s_\yy,
\end{align}
where $\rr = \xx - \yy$. The Stokeslet and rotlets centred at $\aa_i$
are
\begin{align}
  \SS(\xx,\aa_i) \cdot \FF_i &= \frac{1}{4\pi} \left(-\log |\rr| + 
    \frac{\rr \otimes \rr}{|\rr|^2}\right) \cdot \FF_i, \\
  \RR(\xx,\aa_i) T_i &= \frac{1}{4\pi} \frac{\rr^\perp}{|\rr|^2} T_i,
\end{align}
respectively, where $\rr = \xx - \aa_i$. The Stokeslet is torque-free
and has force $\FF_i$ while the rotlet is force-free and has torque
$T_i$. Therefore, the velocity~\eqref{eq:velocity} satisfies the total
force~\eqref{eq:force} and torque~\eqref{eq:torque} conditions if the
double-layer potential $\DD[\eeta]$ is force- and torque-free.  Matching
the limit of~\eqref{eq:velocity} with the rigid body motion, and
imposing that $\DD[\eeta]$ is force- and torque-free, the density
function $\eeta$, translational velocity $\vv_i$, and angular velocity
$\omega_i$ satisfy
\begin{alignat}{3}
  \nonumber
  \vv_i + \omega_i (\xx - \aa_i)^\perp &= \uu_\infty(\xx)
    -\frac{1}{2} \eeta(\xx) + \DD[\eeta](\xx) \\
  \label{eq:SKIE}
    + \sum_{j=1}^{N_b} &
    \left(\SS(\xx,\aa_j) \cdot \FF_j + \RR(\xx,\aa_j) T_j\right),
    \quad &&\xx \in \Gamma_i,\: i=1,\ldots,N_b, \\
  \label{eq:mobility1}
  \int_{\Gamma_i} \eeta \cdot \nnu \, \dif s &= {\bf 0}, 
  &&i = 1,\ldots,N_b, \\
  \label{eq:mobility2}
  \int_{\Gamma_i} \eeta\times(\xx-\aa_i)^\perp \cdot \nnu \, \dif s &= 0,
  &&i = 1,\ldots,N_b.
\end{alignat}

After discretizing and applying appropriate quadrature rules, the result
is a $(2NN_b + 3N_b) \times (2NN_b + 3N_b)$ linear system that we solve
with block-diagonal preconditioned GMRES. Other BIE formulations of the
mobility problem use single-layer potentials (\cite{cor-gre-rac-vee2017,
rac-gre2016}) or a combination of single- and double-layer potentials
(\cite{cor-vee2018}).

We have validated our solver for~\eqref{eq:SKIE}--\eqref{eq:mobility2}
using a single elliptical particle suspended in a background shear flow
(see \S~\ref{sec:ves_in_shear}). Hydrophobic attraction and repulsion
are zero for a single particle (see \cite{Fu20} equation 2.13). The
angle of the ellipse's major axis coming from the integral equation
method agrees with the theoretical, Jeffery orbit time-course
(\cite{jef1922}). 
  
%The Jeffrey orbit  
%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:jeff}
%\Theta(t) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{a}{b}\tan \left(\frac{ab \dot\gamma t}{a^2+b^2}\right)\right)
%\end{equation}
%gives the angle between the major axis and $\mathbf{e}_2$
%where $a$, $b$ are the semi-major and semi-minor axes. 
%We are assuming $\Theta(0) = 0$.
% 

%The background flow is a shear flow $\uu_{\infty}(\xx) = \dot\gamma  \xx \cdot \mathbf{e}_2 \mathbf{e}_1$ with shear rate $\dot\gamma$
%and orthogonal unit vectors $\mathbf{e}_1$ and $\mathbf{e}_2$. 
%A single elliptical particle is suspended in the fluid with center at the origin.
%The Jeffrey orbit  
%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:jeff}
%\Theta(t) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{a}{b}\tan \left(\frac{ab \dot\gamma t}{a^2+b^2}\right)\right)
%\end{equation}
%gives the angle between the major axis and $\mathbf{e}_2$
%where $a$, $b$ are the semi-major and semi-minor axes. 
%We are assuming $\Theta(0) = 0$.
%Figure~\ref{figure1} shows that the angles coming from the integral equation method \eqref{eq:SKIE}-\eqref{eq:mobility2}
%are in complete agreement with the theoretical time course \eqref{eq:jeff}.  Hydrophobic attraction and repulsion are zero for a single particle.

\subsection{Main Theoretical Result: Calculating the Hydrophobic Force}
\label{subsec:calculating_force}
Once \eqref{eq:screenedSKIE} has been solved for $\sigma$, we need to
evaluate the integrals~\eqref{eq:hydrophobicAttraction} which are the
HAP forces and torques. These integrals involve the
stress~\eqref{eq:stress} which contains a singular integral for the
gradient of the double-layer potential. To avoid singular integrals, we
first define
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:uidef}
  w_i(\xx) = \ReviewerTwo{\eta}(\xx) - \ReviewerTwo{\eta}_i(\xx),
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
  \ReviewerTwo{\eta}_i(\xx) &= \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{\Gamma_i} \left(\pderiv{}{\nnu_\yy}
    K_0 \left(\frac{|\xx - \yy|}{\rho}\right)\right) 
    \sigma(\yy) \, \dif s_\yy, \quad \xx \in \mathbb{R}^2.
\end{align}
That is, $w_i(\xx)$ is the double-layer potential~\eqref{eq:HAP_DLP}
with $\Gamma_i$ excluded from $\bd\Omega$. Having defined $w_i$, we prove
\begin{theorem}
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:recipforcetorque}
  \FF_i^{\mathrm{hydro}} = \int_{\Gamma_i} \JJ_i \,\dif s,\quad
  T_i^{\mathrm{hydro}}    = \int_{\Gamma_i} 
    (\xx - \aa_i)^{\perp} \cdot \JJ_i  \,\dif s,
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:jumpstress1}
  \JJ_{i} = 2\gamma\rho^{-1} \sigma w_i \nnu + 
    2\gamma\rho \frac{d\sigma}{ds} \frac{dw_i}{ds} \nnu -
    2\gamma\rho \frac{d\sigma}{ds} \frac{dw_i}{d\nnu} \ttau.
\end{align}
\end{theorem}
The symbols $\ttau$ and $\frac{d}{ds}$ are the unit tangent and arc
length derivative for $\Gamma_i$, respectively (Figure
\ref{fig:figure0}a.) The result is valid for any smooth particle shape
or boundary condition. The advantage of
using~\eqref{eq:recipforcetorque} over
using~\eqref{eq:hydrophobicAttraction} is that the components $\sigma$,
$w_i$, $\frac{d\sigma}{ds}$, and $\frac{dw_i}{ds}$ of $\JJ_i$ are smooth
functions, whereas the components of \eqref{eq:stress} are singular
integrals. 

%To avoid singular integrals, we
%evaluate~\eqref{eq:hydrophobicAttraction} using the identities
%\begin{align}
%  \label{eq:recipforcetorque}
%  \FF_i^{\text{hydro}} = \int_{\Gamma_i} \JJ_i \,\dif s,\quad
%  T_i^{\text{hydro}}    = \int_{\Gamma_i} 
%    (\xx - \aa_i)^{\perp} \cdot \JJ_i  \,\dif s,
%\end{align}
%where
%\begin{align}
%  \label{eq:jumpstress1}
%  \JJ_{i} = 2\gamma\rho^{-1} \sigma v_i \nnu + 
%    2\gamma\rho \frac{d\sigma}{ds} \frac{dv_i}{ds} \nnu -
%    2\gamma\rho \frac{d\sigma}{ds} \frac{dv_i}{d\nu} \ttau.
%\end{align}
%Here, $\ttau$ and $\frac{d}{ds}$ are the unit tangent  and arc length
%derivative for $\Gamma_i$, respectively, and
%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:uidef}
%\begin{aligned}
%    u(\xx) &= u_i(\xx) + v_i(\xx),\\
%    u_i(\xx) &= \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{\Gamma_i} \pderiv{}{\nnu_\yy}
%    K_0 \left(\frac{|\xx - \yy|}{\rho}\right) \sigma(\yy) \, \dif s_\yy,
%    \quad \xx \in \mathbb{R}^2.
%\end{aligned}
%\end{equation}
%That is, $v_i(\xx)$ is the double-layer potential~\eqref{eq:HAP_DLP} with 
%$\Gamma_i$ excluded from $\bd\Omega$. The advantage in
%using \eqref{eq:recipforcetorque} over using \eqref{eq:hydrophobicAttraction} is that the components
%$\sigma$, $v_i$, $\frac{d\sigma}{ds}$, and $\frac{dv_i}{ds}$ of $\JJ_i$ are smooth functions,
%whereas the components of \eqref{eq:stress} are singular integrals.  

To prove \eqref{eq:recipforcetorque}, let 
\begin{align*}
  {\bf T} &=
    \SS(\ReviewerTwo{\eta}_i,\ReviewerTwo{\eta}_i) +(\SS(\ReviewerTwo{\eta}_i,w_i) +\SS(w_i,\ReviewerTwo{\eta}_i)) +\SS(w_i,w_i) \\
  &= {\bf T}_1 + {\bf T}_2 + {\bf T}_3
\end{align*}
where we introduce the bilinear form
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Tsplit}
\SS(\ReviewerTwo{\eta},v)
=  \gamma\rho^{-1} \ReviewerTwo{\eta}v {\bf I} + \gamma\rho \nabla \ReviewerTwo{\eta} \cdot \nabla v {\bf I} - 2 \gamma \rho \nabla \ReviewerTwo{\eta} \nabla v^T.
\end{equation}
Using the fact that $\ReviewerTwo{\eta}$,  $\ReviewerTwo{\eta}_i$, and $w_i$ solve the screened Laplace
equation~\eqref{eq:SL}, and that $\mathbf{T}$, $\mathbf{T}_j$, $j = 1,
2, 3$ are symmetric, it is straightforward to verify that 
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:decompdivfree}
    \nabla \cdot {\bf T}_j = 0, \quad
    \nabla \cdot ((\xx-\aa_i)^{\perp} \cdot {\bf T}_j) = 0, \quad j = 1, 2, 3.
  \end{equation}

%\begin{lemma}
%  \label{eq:stress_div_lemma}
%  \begin{equation}
%    \label{eq:decompdivfree}
%    \nabla \cdot {\bf T}_j = 0, \quad
%    \nabla \cdot (\xx^{\perp} \cdot {\bf T}_j) = 0
%  \end{equation}
% for  $ j = 1, 2, 3$.
%\end{lemma}
%\begin{proof}
%  Let $\mathbf{T}$ be as in \eqref{eq:stress}.  
%  It is straightforward to show that  
%%  \begin{align*}
% %   (\nabla \cdot {\bf T})_j &=
% %   \nabla_k   T_{jk}  = 0\\
% %   &= \rho^{-1} 2u \nabla_j u + \rho(2\nabla_{kl}^2 u \nabla_l u  - 2 \nabla_{kj}^2 u \nabla_k u
% %  - 2 \nabla_j u \nabla_{kk}^2 u )\\
% %   &=2\rho^{-1}(-\rho^2 \Delta u + u)\nabla_j u = 0,
% % \end{align*}
% \begin{equation*}
%\nabla \cdot {\bf T} = 2\rho^{-1}(-\rho^2 \Delta u + u)\nabla u = 0
% \end{equation*}
% since $u$ solves $-\rho^2 \Delta u + u = 0$.
% Moreover,
%  \begin{align*}
%    \nabla \cdot (\xx^{\perp} \cdot {\bf T} )
%%    &= \nabla_k (\epsilon_{jml}x_m T_{lk})\\
%%    &= \varepsilon_{jml} T_{lm} + \varepsilon_{jml}x_m \nabla_k T_{lk}\\
%%   &= (\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}:{\bf T} + {\bf x}^{\perp} \cdot \nabla \cdot {\bf T})_j.
%=  \mathbf{S}:\mathbf{T} + \mathbf{S}\xx \cdot (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{T}) = 0,
%  \end{align*}
%  since ${\bf T}$ is symmetric, where $\mathbf{S}\xx = \xx^{\perp}$.
%  
%  The functions $u_i$ and $v_i$ also solve the equation $-\rho^2 \Delta u + u = 0$.  Repeating the above argument 
%  for ${\bf T}_1 = \sigma[u_i,u_i]$ and ${\bf T}_3 = \sigma[v_i,v_i]$ gives that 
%  \eqref{eq:decompdivfree} holds for the cases $j = 1$ and $j = 3$. Finally,
%  \eqref{eq:decompdivfree} holds for the case $j = 2$ because
%  ${\bf T}_2 = {\bf T} - {\bf T}_1 - {\bf T}_3$.
%\end{proof}

Let $U_i$ be the interior of the particle indexed by $i$. For $\xx_0
\in \Gamma_i$ and an arbitrary function $g(\xx)$, the notation
\begin{align}
  \jump{g}(\xx_0) = \lim_{\substack{\xx \to \xx_0 \\ \xx \in U_i^c}}g(\xx)  - 
                    \lim_{\substack{\xx \to \xx_0 \\ \xx \in U_i}}g(\xx),
\end{align}
denotes the jump of the limits of $g(\xx)$ taken from the outside to
the inside of $\Gamma_i$.
%\begin{align}
%\lim_{\xx \to \xx_0^+}g(\xx),\quad 
%\lim_{\xx \to \xx_0^-}g(\xx), \quad
%  \jump{g}(\xx_0) = \lim_{\xx \to \xx_0^+}g(\xx)  - \lim_{\xx \to \xx_0^-}g(\xx)
%\end{align}
%denotes the limit taken from points in $U_i^c$,  the limit taken from
%points in $U_i$, and the jump, respectively.  
\begin{lemma}
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:prejump}
  \FF_i^{\mathrm{hydro}} = \int_{\Gamma_i} \jump{{\bf T}_2 \cdot \nnu}  \, \dif s,\quad
  T_i^{\mathrm{hydro}} = \int_{\Gamma_i} (\xx - \aa_i)^{\perp} \cdot
  \jump{{\bf T}_2 \cdot \nnu} \, \dif s.
\end{align}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
To show~\eqref{eq:prejump}, we expand \eqref{eq:hydrophobicAttraction} as
\begin{align}
  \FF_i = \int_{\Gamma_i} \left({\bf T}_1 \cdot \nnu + 
    {\bf T}_2 \cdot \nnu + {\bf T}_3 \cdot \nnu \right) \,\dif s.
\end{align}
By~\eqref{eq:uidef} and~\eqref{eq:decompdivfree}, we have that $u_i$ is
smooth and $\nabla \cdot {\bf T}_1 = \mathbf{0}$ in $\mathbb{R}^n
\setminus U_i$. Similarly, $w_i = \ReviewerTwo{\eta} - \ReviewerTwo{\eta}_i$ is smooth and $\nabla \cdot
{\bf T}_3 = \mathbf{0}$ in $U_i$. By the divergence theorem,  
\begin{align}
  \int_{\Gamma_i}  {\bf T}_1 \cdot \nnu \,\dif s
  = -\int_{\mathbb{R}^n \setminus U_i} \nabla \cdot {\bf T}_1 \,\dif \xx = \mathbf{0},\quad
    \int_{\Gamma_i}  {\bf T}_3 \cdot \nnu\,\dif s
  = \int_{U_i} \nabla \cdot {\bf T}_3 \,\dif \xx = \mathbf{0}.
\end{align}
Finally, $u_i$ and $w_i$ are smooth and $\nabla \cdot {\bf T}_2= 0$ in $U_i$. This gives
\begin{align}
  \mathbf{0} = \int_{U_i} \nabla \cdot {\bf T}_2 \, \dif \xx = \int_{\Gamma_i}  
    ({\bf T}_2 \cdot \nnu)^-\,\dif s,
\end{align}
where the superscript denotes the limit taken from in $U_i$.  
Combining the above gives the first equation in \eqref{eq:prejump}.
The derivation for the second equation in \eqref{eq:prejump} is identical. 
\end{proof}

We have the following jump relations for \eqref{eq:uidef}: 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:DLjump}
\jump{\ReviewerTwo{\eta}_i} = \sigma, \quad
\jump{w_i} = 0, \quad
\jump{\nabla \ReviewerTwo{\eta}_i} = \frac{\dif \sigma}{\dif s}\ttau,\quad
\jump{\nabla w_i} = \mathbf{0},
\end{equation}
on $\Gamma_i$ (see, e.g., \cite{KlBaGrON13}). Therefore,
\begin{align*}
  \jump{{\bf T}_2 \cdot \nnu}   &= \jump{\SS(\ReviewerTwo{\eta}_i,w_i) \cdot \nnu +
    \SS(w_i,\ReviewerTwo{\eta}_i) \cdot \nnu} \\
  &= \Big[\!\Big[ \left( 2\gamma\rho^{-1} \ReviewerTwo{\eta}_i w_i \mathbf{I} + 2\gamma\rho \nabla \ReviewerTwo{\eta}_i \cdot \nabla w_i \mathbf{I} 
- 2\gamma\rho \nabla \ReviewerTwo{\eta}_i  \nabla w_i^T - 2\gamma\rho \nabla w_i \nabla
  \ReviewerTwo{\eta}_i^T\right) \cdot \nnu \Big]\!\Big] \\
%  &= \jump{\left( 2\gamma\rho^{-1} u_i v_i \mathbf{I} + 2\gamma\rho \nabla u_i \cdot \nabla v_i \mathbf{I} 
%- 2\gamma\rho \nabla u_i  \nabla v_i^T - 2\gamma\rho \nabla v_i \nabla
%  u_i^T\right) \cdot \nnu}\\
&= 2\gamma\rho^{-1} \sigma w_i \nnu + 2\gamma\rho \frac{d\sigma }{ds}\frac{dw_i }{ds} \nnu
- 2\gamma\rho \ \frac{d\sigma }{ds} \frac{dw_i }{d\nnu} \ttau = \JJ_i.
\end{align*}

\subsection{Time Marching}
To summarize, the proposed algorithm aims to obtain the JP velocities ${\bf v}_i$ and $\omega_i$. 
After calculating the imposed forces $\FF_i$ and torques $T_i$, 
two density functions $\sigma$ and  $\eeta$ are solved in the second-kind integral equations involving the HAP~\eqref{eq:screenedSKIE} and the mobility problem~\eqref{eq:SKIE}-\eqref{eq:mobility2} via GMRES.
%By solving the mobility problem, we obtain translational and angular
%velocities of the $N_b$-body system. 
Moreover, a second-order Adams-Bashforth
scheme updates the particle positions and orientations. By including the
repulsion force~\eqref{eq:REPULforce}, particle collisions can be avoided by setting time step
size $\Delta t\sim O(10^{-1})$.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Model Parameters}
\cite{Fu20} studied physical quantities for static JP vesicles. 
In the present work, we study JP vesicles in various background flows.
We also perform parametric studies of effective properties of the JP vesicles 
as a function of particle size and interaction strength.
An analysis of the relationship between particle shape on effective properties is beyond 
the scope of the current paper. 

The particles are circular disks with centres 
$\aa_i$ and unit-length directors $\dd_i$ (Figure \ref{fig:figure0}(a)).
The simulations use the reference length $l_0 = 2.5$~nm representing the
thickness of a lipid monolayer.
The boundary conditions~\eqref{eq:SLbc} are $f_i(\xx) = \tfrac{1}{2}(1 + \cos
\theta_i)$ where $\theta_i$ is the angle between $\xx - \aa_i$ and
$\dd_i$.
We nondimensionalize the PDE systems 
\eqref{eq:stokes}-\eqref{eq:total_forces}
problem through the change of variables 
%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:nondimensionalize}
$t \mapsto t \text{ ns}$,
$\xx \mapsto \xx \text{ nm}$, %\quad 
$\uu \mapsto \uu \text{ nm ns}^{-1}$, and %\quad 
$p \mapsto p \text{ pN nm}^{-2}$.
%\end{equation}
The numerical time step size is $\Delta t=0.2$.

The base-case is a single JP vesicle consisting of $N_b = 58$ particles
with $c = 0.5 l_0$ for particle radius, $\rho = 2 l_0$ for decay length,
$\gamma = \text{4.1 pN nm}^{-1}$ for interfacial tension.
The parameter $\mu = \text{1 cP} = \text{1 pN
ns nm}^{-2}$ is viscosity of room-temperature water. 
\ReviewerThree{
  We select \ReviewerOne{$M=4.0$~$\text{pN}$} and $\rho_0 = 0.2l_0$ so that \eqref{eq:REPULforce}
  prevents particle collisions and is comparable to hydrodynamic lubrication.
  \citep{cawthorn_balmforth_2010} provide the asymptotic expression 
  $F_{\text{lubr}} = -\tfrac{3}{2}\pi \mu \dot \epsilon (c/\epsilon)^{3/2}$
  for the lubrication force between two cylinders in the distance of separation $\epsilon \to 0$.
  For our choice of simulation parameters, $F_{\text{lubr}}$ and \eqref{eq:REPULforce} are comparable
  because the particle gaps are comparable to the particle radius
  and the relative velocities $\dot \epsilon$ between particles are on
  the order of nm $\text{ns}^{-1}$.
}


To reach consistent simulation outcomes, we first solve for a baseline
JP \ReviewerThree{vesicle} that is suitably close to equilibrium. We
start with an assumed configuration of $N=58$ JP in the form of two,
circular, apposing monolayers of about $8$ nm in radius. The norms of
the translational and rotational velocities vanish exponentially with an
approximate decay rate $\sim 4.6$ $\upmu$s$^{-1}$. An equilibrium
configuration is therefore rapidly attained. This equilibrium
configuration serves as the initial data in the subsequent background
flow simulations.

For a single JP vesicle, we consider background flows for a shear flow 
(Section \ref{sec:ves_in_shear}), 
a parabolic flow (Section \ref{sec:ves_in_parabolic}),
and a quiescent flow (Section \ref{sec:ves_in_parabolic}). 
In addition to observing the familiar tank-treading motion, the shear
flow studies yield a friction coefficient for inter-monolayer slip 
and a critical rupture shear rate.  Permeability coefficients and 
stretching moduli arise from analyzing stretched JP vesicles in the 
quiescent background flow case.  
 
%\subsection{Jeffery Orbit}
%We use Jeffery orbits to numerically validate our solver for the mobility-problem.  
%The background flow is a shear flow $\uu_{\infty}(\xx) = \dot\gamma  \xx \cdot \mathbf{e}_2 \mathbf{e}_1$ with shear rate $\dot\gamma$
%and orthogonal unit vectors $\mathbf{e}_1$ and $\mathbf{e}_2$. 
%A single elliptical particle is suspended in the fluid with centre at the origin.
%The Jeffrey orbit  
%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:jeff}
%\Theta(t) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{a}{b}\tan \left(\frac{ab \dot\gamma t}{a^2+b^2}\right)\right)
%\end{equation}
%gives the angle between the major axis and $\mathbf{e}_2$
%where $a$, $b$ are the semi-major and semi-minor axes. 
%We are assuming $\Theta(0) = 0$.
%Figure~\ref{figure1} shows that the angles coming from the integral equation method \eqref{eq:SKIE}-\eqref{eq:mobility2}
%are in complete agreement with the theoretical time course \eqref{eq:jeff}.  Hydrophobic attraction and repulsion are zero for a single particle.

\subsubsection{Vesicle in a Shear Flow}
\label{sec:ves_in_shear}
Our simulation studies begin by showing, for the first time, that a JP
suspension with hydrophobic attraction behaves as a tank-treading
vesicle (\cite{Finken08, Shaqfeh11}). The centroid of the baseline,
$58$-body JP vesicle lies at the origin and the background shear flow 
\begin{align}
  \uu_{\infty}(\xx) = \dot\gamma (\xx \cdot \mathbf{e}_y) \mathbf{e}_x,
\end{align} 
is applied for shear rate $\dot\gamma$, and orthogonal unit vectors
$\mathbf{e}_x$ and $\mathbf{e}_y$ for the horizontal and vertical
directions, respectively. We use the dimensionless shear rate $\chi =
\dot \gamma$ (s$^{-1}$) ns.

\caption{\label{figure5} Inter-monolayer slip is present in the JP
  vesicle tank-treading motion at all shear rates. Panel (a) tracks a
  pair of particles (blue and yellow). The shear rate is $\chi=0.005$
  and in the right figure, the yellow particle will complete two and a
  quarter revolutions in the same time the blue particle completes two
  revolutions. The curves in panel (b) are the distance the outer
  leaflet has slid past the inner leaflet. The slopes of the curves
  give the slip velocity. 
  Slip velocity is generally monotonic in the shear rate.
  The case $\chi = 0.003$ is an exception.}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{figure3} shows snapshots of the JP vesicle in the shear flow
with $\chi=0.0025$. Under the background flow, the rigid-body boundary
condition~\eqref{eq:rigid_bc} causes the particle suspension to
elongate. This perturbation disrupts the preferred particle orientations
and exposes the hydrophobic core to bulk water (Figure~\ref{figure3},
red region). In response, hydrophobic
attraction~\eqref{eq:hydrophobicAttraction} causes the particles to
reorient and form a somewhat elliptically-shaped suspension. Panel (a)
shows the initial configuration and panel (b) shows the later,
fully-formed, clockwise tank-treading motion. The JP suspension
maintains its bilayer structure throughout the simulation. 
%

To extract physical quantities, let $A^* = 4\pi A/L^2$ be the reduced
area and $\Delta=L/\sqrt{A/\pi} - 2\pi$ the excess length of the bilayer
structure (\cite{Finken08}). Here, $A$ is the enclosed area and $L$ is
the total length of the JP vesicle (Figure \ref{fig:figure0}a).
Figure~\ref{figure4} shows the evolution of the area and length for
various shear rates. Panels (a) and (b) show that $A^*$ decreases and
$\Delta$ increases with time, respectively, and that the rate of
decrease/increase grows with shear rate. The total arc length, however,
remains constant for all time for all four shear rates (panel (c)). We
conclude that the JP vesicle loses area and that the bilayer behaves as
a permeable membrane. 

Since the starting configuration is nearly circular, the reduced area
decreases from an initial value close to $1$ and tends to a steady-state
value $A^*_{\infty}$. The data in panel (a) are fit to the model $A^* =
A^*_{\infty} + a_1 \exp(-k_1t) + a_2 \exp(-k_2t),$ $0 < k_2 <
k_1$. Panel (d) shows that $A^*_{\infty}$ decreases with the shear rate.
The JP vesicle achieves a steady-state reduced area earlier when the
shear rate is low (inset), but the decay rate $k_2$ is more or less
constant for higher shearer rates. 

\ReviewerThree{The time courses contain oscillations due to the
granularity of the JP vesicle.
The curve for $\chi = 0.003$ in Figure~\ref{figure4}a, for example, 
has a low-frequency oscillation with a period around $0.7$ $\upmu$s,
and a high-frequency oscillation with a period four times smaller.
The JP vesicle is somewhat hexagonal (see, e.g., Figure~\ref{figure5}a)
and the low-frequency oscillations corresponds to the tank-treading of a 
polygon, rather than smooth, curve. The higher frequency oscillations
come from the trank-treading of individual particles, that is
they correspond to the rate of passage of particles through a fixed-angle
axis about the vesicle centre.} 
The inset of Figure~\ref{figure4}c zooms
in on the arc length data for the shear rate $\chi = 0.003$. It shows
that the curves are smooth and well-resolved by our second-order
Adams-Bashforth scheme.

We point out that the range of values for $\chi$ where we measured for
tank-treading correspond to shear rates $\dot \gamma = \mathcal{O}(10^6$
s$^{-1}$) which gives fluid velocities $\mathcal{O}($m s$^{-1}$$)$ in
the vicinity of the vesicle. While large, these orders of magnitude are identical to
ones used in prior MD studies (\cite{Brandner2019}) and are a
consequence of the fact that larger shear rates are required to produce
the viscous stresses needed to appreciably deform smaller vesicles. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Inter-Monolayer Friction}
We observe inter-monolayer slip in the tank-treading, JP vesicle at all
shear rates. Since they are not bound, the two leaflets of the vesicle
are able to slide past one another. 
Monolayer slip effects have been incorporated in continuum models (\cite{sch-vla-mik2010}).
In the present setting, slip is limited by viscous
friction of the aqueous gaps between particles and by the constant
unbinding and binding of particles pairs in apposing leaflets. 


Figure~\ref{figure5}a illustrates inter-monolayer slip by tracking the distances
traveled by a pair of particles along the midplane curve. In the left image, the blue and yellow
particle lie next to each other. In the right-most panel, the yellow
particle has traveled farther than the blue particle. This suggests that
the outer tangential velocity, obtained by projecting the velocity of the
outer leaflet onto the midplane curve, 
is larger than that of the inner leaflet. 

From the data, we obtain an inter-monolayer friction coefficient 
\begin{align}
  b =  \frac{\langle F \rangle}{\langle L   U \rangle} ,
\end{align}
where $F$ is the tangential force jump, $L$ is the length of the
midplane $C_M$ (Figure~\ref{figure5}a), and $U$ is the slip velocity.
The time average $\langle \cdot \rangle$ is necessary to avoid division by zero
whenever slip velocity vanishes.

The tangential force jump $F$ equals the 
tangential shear force on the outer
leaflet minus the tangential shear force on the inner leaflet. 
To calculate  $F$, we first let 
\begin{align}
F_h = \int_{\mathcal{C}_M^+} 
  \ttau \cdot \sigma \cdot \nnu \,\dif s - \int_{\mathcal{C}_M^-} 
 \ttau \cdot \sigma \cdot \nnu \,\dif s 
\end{align}
where $C_M^+$ and $C_M^-$ are target curves obtained by projecting the
midplane curve $C_M$  a distance $h$ outward,
respectively inward, along its unit normal vector field (Figure~\ref{figure5}a). We sample $F_h$ for 
$h = \pm 1.3, \pm 1.5,  \pm 1.7, \pm 1.9$ times the particle radius and define $F$ by
extrapolating to zero distance. This avoids integrating along a curve passing directly through the
particles.   

To calculate $U$, we let $u_+(\mathbf{x})$ and $u_-(\mathbf{x})$ 
be the tangential velocity of the outer, respectively inner, leaflet.  Then 
\begin{equation}
  U = \frac{1}{L}\int_{C_M}\left(u_+(\mathbf{x})(1 - \delta \kappa) -
  u_-(\mathbf{x})(1 +  \delta \kappa)\right) \, ds,
\end{equation}
where $ \delta $ is the distance from the leaflet centres to the midplane and $\kappa$ is the curvature. 
The factors $\pm  \delta \kappa$ are needed to project the leaflet velocities, defined on the particle centres,
onto the midplane curve. 
Finally, the function $s(t) = \int_0^t dU $ records the distance one leaflet has
slid past the other. Figure~\ref{figure5}b plots the sliding distance for various shear
rates. 

%Table~\ref{table1} provides $b = 0.79 \pm 0.3$ pN ns nm$^{-3}$  
\ReviewerOne{Table~\ref{table1} provides a series of numerical friction coefficients $b$ and the baseline number of particles is $N_b = 58$. With the fixed total length of the JP vesicle, we change parameters related to the length scale, for instances, $\rho$, $\rho_0$, and the radius of particles.
With $-5\%$, $5\%$, and $10\%$ adjustments in these parameters, the resulting numbers of particles are $N_b=\{61,56,53\}$, respectively. }

\ReviewerOne{The overall trend shown in Table~\ref{table1} is values of $b$ decreases as $\rho$
decreases and $b$ are}
%over a range of shear rates which is 
in good quantitative agreement with values previously reported in the literature.
Atomistic studies have also considered inter-monolayer slip in lipid bilayers. 
\cite{WuoEd06} and \cite{denOtter2007} reported $b = 0.7 \times 10^6$ Pa m$^{-1}$ s  
$=0.7$ pN ns nm$^{-3}$  
and $b = 2.4$  pN ns nm$^{-3}$ for DPPC membranes simulated by MD, respectively. 
Using a more recent version of the Martini force field, \cite{Zgorski2019} 
gives $b = 5.5$ pN ns nm$^{-3}$ for shear rates 0.4 ns$^{-1}$ and higher.
It is understandable that there is uncertainty in the friction coefficients of
Table~\ref{table1}.  The scatter in our data, however, is fully consistent with that calculated
from MD simulations, c.f. the transient rise in values of Table~\ref{table1} and in \cite{Zgorski2019}, Figure 10
for low shear rates.

%

\ReviewerOne{An emperical numerical study found that for the baseline parameter set,
the dimensionless, critical shear rate is $\chi_*=0.0655$ so that the membrane ruptured whenever $\chi > \chi_*$
  and did not rupture whenever $\chi < \chi_*.$ 
  Supplementary Materials Movie 4 shows the membrane rupture at the critical shear rate.
  To further quantify the competition between shear and attraction,
  we found that a 5 \% relative increase in the parameters $\gamma$ and $M$ 
  resulted in a  4.24 \% relative increase in $\chi_*$, from $0.0655$ to $0.0688$.
  A 5 \% decrease in the particle radius $c$ gave a -9.55 \% decrease in $\chi_*$
  and a 10 \% increase in resting length $L_0$ gave a 20.61 \% decrease in critical shear rate $\chi_*$.
  These relative changes suggest that there is dimensionless number $K$ given by 
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:CSR}
  \mu \dot\gamma_* = K \frac{\gamma c^2}{\rho L^2}
  \end{equation}
  that relates hydrophobic attraction to the dimensional critical shear rate $\dot \gamma_* = \chi_* \text{ ns}^{-1}$.
  Assuming a characteristic velocity $L\dot \gamma$, the number $K$ relates to the vesicle's capillary number
  $\text{Ca} = K c^2/(\rho L)$. Here $\text{Ca}$ would be approximately $1.7$
  so that surface forces are comparable to viscous forces.  
  There is a related \emph{elastic} capillary number
  $\tilde{\text{Ca}} = \mu \dot{\gamma} R_0^3/\kappa$
  used to characterize rheological properties of lipid bilayer membranes
  where $R_0$ is vesicle radius $\kappa$ is bending rigidity \citep{VLAHOVSKA2009775, keller_skalak_1982}. 
  Setting $\text{Ca}$ and $\tilde{\text{Ca}}$ equal, we can derive
  \[
  \kappa = \frac{\mu \dot \gamma_* R_0^3}{\text{Ca}}
  \]
  which yields $\kappa \approx 60$ pN $\text{nm}^{-1}$, which is a reasonable
  value for the bending modulus of a lipid bilayer, for example \citep{NaTr00}.}

\subsubsection{Vesicle in a Parabolic Flow}
\label{sec:ves_in_parabolic}
Finally, we consider the parabolic background flow
\begin{align}
  \uu_\infty = v_{max}\left[ 1 - \left( 
    \frac{\xx \cdot \mathbf{e}_y}{wR_0}\right)^2
    \right]\mathbf{e}_x,
\end{align}
%
where $v_{max}$ is the flow strength and $w$ determines the shape of the
flow. The parameter $R_0$ is the radius of the JP vesicle at $t=0$ and
$w$ sets the width of the profile. \cite{Kaoui09, cou-kao-pod-mis2008,
dan-vla-mis2009} have shown that the behaviour of a vesicle in this
unbounded flow includes vertical migration, and depending on the flow
rate and reduced area, the steady-state shape can be either a symmetric
parachute or an asymmetric slipper.

%Besides the tests of a JP vesicle in a shear flow, an interesting
%test can also use the proposed model and the setup. Consider a
%symmetric parabolic flow about the $x$-axis,~\cite{Kaoui09} studied
%shapes of the red blood cell immersed in a parabolic flow using a
%continuum model. With a similar setup, the background flow for this set
%of simulations is given by

Figure~\ref{figure6} shows four configurations for one specific case
where the centroid of the JP vesicle is initially placed slightly above
the $x$-axis. We have marked a pair of particles blue and yellow in the
inner and outer leaflets, respectively, and observe that the deformed JP
vesicle (Figure~\ref{figure6}, $t = 12~\upmu$s) has a counterclockwise
movement and the shape of the vesicle approaches an asymmetric slipper
shape. For this test, the reduced area in the final configuration is
approximately $0.9$ which matches the previous numerical tests
in~\cite{Kaoui09} where a slipper-like shape occurs when the flow
velocity is weak and the reduced area is large. The flow causes the
vesicle, which is initially placed above the axis, to drift downward
where it reaches a steady height of about $1$ nm.

\subsection{Stretching and Permeability}
\label{sec:ves_in_quiescent}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figure2_part1_Wrapper.pdf}
\caption{\label{figure2part1} Tension and pressure relax as
  fluid is expelled through the particle interstices. In panel (a), inset, 
  pressure is spatially constant inside the JP vesicle (inset). and 
  Laplace pressure ((a), squares) and excess length ((b), squares) dissipate exponentially.  
  The data in panels (b) and (c) show a linear relationship expressed by
  \eqref{eq:LaplacePressure} and \eqref{eq:perm}. }
\end{figure}
In this section, we consider a circular JP vesicle suspended in a quiescent flow $\uu_{\infty} = 0$.
We show that the JP particle bilayer behaves as an inextensible, permeable membrane with
the inextensibility coming from a large stretching modulus.

In membrane continuum  mechanics, changes in membrane surface area $A$ give rise to a tension
$\tilde \sigma = K_A(A/A_0 - 1)$ where $A_0$ is the reference surface area \cite{NaTr00}. 
For a two-dimensional membrane, the tension is 
\begin{align}
\label{eq:stretch}
\tilde \sigma = K_A\left(L/L_0 - 1 \right),
\end{align}
where $L$ and $L_0$ are arc length and resting length,
respectively. 
Membrane tension gives rise to 
a Laplace pressure 
\begin{align}
\label{eq:LaplacePressure}
\Delta p = \tilde \sigma/R,
\end{align}
where $\Delta p$ is the jump in far-field pressure to internal pressure and
$R = L/2\pi$.
In order to relieve Laplace pressure, 
water flows across the membrane. The rate of efflux is governed by  
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:perm} 
  \frac{dA}{dt} = - P\Delta p,
\end{align}
where $P = k/(\mu \Delta x)$ is a constant, $k$ is hydraulic permeability, 
$\mu$ is the solvent viscosity, and $\Delta x$ is the 
membrane thickness, about 5 nm
(\cite{chabanon2017, qua-gan-you2021}).

Our  simulation setup consists of an initial, non-equilibrium JP
obtained by dilating the equilibrium shape outward (Figures~\ref{figure2part1}a).
At $t = 0$, pressure \eqref{eq:stokes} is spatially constant  inside and outside the vesicle 
(Figures~\ref{figure2part1}a, inset)
and Laplace pressure decreases to zero exponentially 
(Figures~\ref{figure2part1}a,  squares).  
At the same time, arc length decreases from its initial value $L(0)$ to its resting length $L_0$
(Figures~\ref{figure2part1}b).

To evaluate whether JP vesicles possess a stretching modulus,
Figure~\ref{figure2part1}c plots $R \Delta p$ against the excess length $L/L_0 - 1$.  The squares
are for the baseline simulation with vesicle diameter about 34 nm.  The diamonds 
are for a vesicle with twice the diameter.  The linear relationships 
are independent of vesicle size and give an area modulus $K_A = 170 \pm 9$ pN nm$^{-1}$.
 This relatively large stretching modulus is the reason why the JP vesicle conserves length in the 
shear-flow simulations (Figure \ref{figure2part1}c).
The value also reasonably agrees with stretching moduli for 
lipid bilayers, around $240$ pN nm$^{-1}$ \cite{NaTr00}.

 In the initial, dilated vesicle,
contractile motion is limited by the incompressibility of the 
fluid bound by the vesicle.  
Hence, the Laplace pressure 
comes from an excess in inter-particle separation.  The vesicle-bound water,
however, can escape through the gaps between the particles and this
is how the JP vesicle relieves Laplace pressure over time (Figure \ref{figure2part1}a).  

To evaluate the rate of water outflow, 
Figure~\ref{figure2part1}d plots the the simulation values for $dA/dt$.  
These values are proportional to $L\Delta p$ and like for the stretching modulus, 
the proportionality constants are 
independent of vesicle size.
The  linear fits give a hydraulic permeability $P = 0.0290 \pm 0.007$ nm$^3$ ns$^{-1}$ pN$^{-1}$.
We can combine~\eqref{eq:stretch},~\eqref{eq:LaplacePressure},
and~\eqref{eq:perm} to derive
\begin{align}
\label{eq:perm_solution}
L_0(L-L(0)) + L_0^2 \ln\left|\frac{L-L_0}{L(0)-L_0}\right| = -4\pi^2 P K_A t.
\end{align}
Using the fitted values for $P$ and $K_A$, the theoretical time course for 
\eqref{eq:perm_solution} (Figure~\ref{figure2part1}b, solid curve) is in good
agreement with the JP data (Figure~\ref{figure2part1}b, squares).

Our value for permeability disagrees 
with permeabilities for lipid bilayers by a few orders of magnitude  (\cite{chabanon2017, qua-gan-you2021}).
Potential reasons for this include the following. 
Our two-dimensional simulations correspond to water flowing past a collection
of parallel cylinders, which has a larger permeability than for a collection
of spheres of comparable radius.   
Second, permeability vanishes with inter-particle separation.  
However, in our simulations, inter-particle separation is intentionally made comparable to 
particle radius to avoid aggresive mesh refinement.

We performed a parametric study of the dependence of $K_A$ and $P$
on model parameters taking into account   
(i) changes in interfacial strength and (ii) changes in size.
Table~\ref{table2} provides the results of stretching moduli $K_A$ and permeabilities $P$ for various cases.
 The baseline setup is shown in the first row.
The next two rows demonstrate the results when the tension related parameters $\gamma$ and $M$ are increased by 5$\%$ and 10$\%$. 
The final two rows show the results for the cases where the length scale related parameters are decreased by 5$\%$ and 10$\%$
This data comes from Figure \ref{figure2} which  plots the \emph{ratio} of the abscissa and ordinates
used in Figure \ref{figure2part1}c, d. The transformed data are fit by constant functions.  

Increases in $\gamma$ and $M$ result in
a commensurate increase in the stretching modulus. 
Permeability, however, is insensitive to simultaneous increases in $\gamma$ and $M$.
To give a detailed explanation for this, the JP system has the potential energy $E = G + H$ where 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:baseline_energy}
G = \gamma \int_{\Omega} \rho |\nabla \ReviewerTwo{\eta}|^2 + \rho^{-1} \ReviewerTwo{\eta}^2 \,\dif\xx,\quad H = M \sum_{i=1}^{N_b}\sum_{j \neq i} 
       P(|\tilde{\xx}_i - \tilde{\xx}_j|).
\end{equation}
Here, $G$ is the hydrophobic attraction potential for the boundary value problem \eqref{eq:SL}--\eqref{eq:SLff},
and $H$ is the repulsion potential.  
For the circular vesicle, total energy depends only on the characteristic inter-particle distance $x$
and has a minimum at $x_0$. 
If $\gamma$ and $M$ are scaled by $c$, 
we can related the scaled energy to that of the baseline case by 
\[E_c(x) = c(G(x) + H(x)).\]
Permeability does not change with like increases in $\gamma$ and $M$
because the critical number for $E_c$, and hence inter-particle separations, are independent to $c$.
The stretching modulus comes from $\frac{d^2E_c}{dx^2}$ and this 
quantity varies proportionally with $c$. 

One can observe that $K_A$ increases and $P$ decreases as the length scale decreases. 
The decrease in  $P$ is expected because 
the size of the gap between adjacent JP particles is directly proportional to length scale.
To give a more detailed account, pressure $p$ and water flux across the membrane $q$ scale as 
$p_{\lambda}(\mathbf{x}) = \lambda^{-1} p(\mathbf{x}/\lambda)$ and 
$q_{\lambda}(\mathbf{x}) = q(\mathbf{x}/\lambda)$ 
when $l_0$ is scaled by $\lambda$. As a result, the scaled permeability constant satisfies 
\[
P_{\lambda} = q_{\lambda}/\Delta p_{\lambda} = q/(\lambda^{-1} \Delta p) = \lambda P.
\]
For the stretching modulus, the total energy transforms as 
\[E_{\lambda}(x) = \lambda G(x/\lambda) + H(x/\lambda ).\]
The factor $\lambda$ comes from the change of 
variables formula for the integral in \eqref{eq:baseline_energy}.
The stretching modulus increases because $\frac{d^2E_{\lambda}}{dx^2}$ increases with decreases in $\lambda.$

\subsubsection{Shear Flow}
Finally, we can study vesicle-vesicle interactions in background flows. 
Figure~\ref{figure9} shows the simulation of two JP vesicles suspended
in a shear flow with shear rate $\chi=0.005$. We duplicate the
pre-relaxed $58$-body JP vesicle from previous sections and construct the
initial configuration shown in Figure~\ref{figure9}a. The two centroids
are at coordinates $(-25,0)$ and $(25,0)$ in nm. In all panels, the blue and red
curves show the trajectory of the two JP vesicle centroids. They have
nearly completed a full period by $t=4$ $\upmu$s. 

We show snapshots of the fluid pressure in Figure~\ref{figure10}. Since the
initial JP vesicles are pre-relaxed, there is initially no pressure jump
between the internal and external fluids (panel (a)). Panels (b)--(d)
show the configurations when $t = \{0.5,1,1.5\}$ $\upmu$s, and the
streamlines are plotted in the background for all panels. 
We include the numerical results from a continuum model in all insets and these
comparisons give a qualitative agreement between two models.
We also observe an adhesive
effect between the two JP vesicles that is set up by the hydrophobic
attraction (Figure~\ref{figure10}c). Similar dynamics have been observed between a pair of adhering vesicles in a shear flow
(\cite{qua-vee-you2019, abb-far-ezz-ben-mis2021}). This adhesive
behaviour is absent when two JP vesicles are well-separated.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Extensional Flow}

Using a similar setup to the shear flow case, we suspend the same two,
pre-relaxed, $58$-body JP vesicles and consider their dynamics in an
extensional flow 
\begin{equation}
\uu_{\infty}(\xx) = \dot \gamma ((\mathbf{e}_x \cdot \xx)\mathbf{e}_x - (\mathbf{e}_y \cdot \xx)\mathbf{e}_y)
\end{equation}
with extensional rate $\dot \gamma =0.005$ ns$^{-1}$. This extensional
flow is stretching in the $y$-direction and squeezing in the
$x$-direction. Figure~\ref{figure11} shows how the initial placement of
the JP vesicles affects the dynamics. When two centroids are both placed
symmetrically on the $x$-axis (case (i)), the JP vesicles come into
contact and reach a steady equilibrium. If one centroid is placed above
the $x$-axis (case (ii)), the two JP vesicle move together and then
upward. The migration of the right JP vesicle is a consequence of the
adhesive effect caused by the hydrophobic interactions. When the two
centroids start on opposite sides of the $x$-axis (case (iii)), they
eventually diverge from one another along the $\pm y$-directions.
Finally, when the two centroids start on opposite sides of the $x$-axis,
but with a greater displacement (case (iv)), the JP vesicles move much
faster along the $\pm y$-directions.

Figure~\ref{figure12} shows numerical results when the centroids of the
two Janus particles are placed at $(-10,-0.1)$~nm and $(10,0.1)$~nm
(case (iii) from Figure~\ref{figure11}). With this setup, the two JP
vesicles eventually separate along the $\pm y$-directions and we compare
the results against a continuum model as shown in all insets. Panels
(b)--(d) show the transient behaviour of the JP vesicles and the
continuum vesicles under an extensional flow. In both the coarse-grained
model and the continuum model, the vesicles initially converge towards
one other and then diverge along the $y$-axis. The behaviour of the
streamlines in both cases are similar. The pressure is initially largest
in the gap formed by two JP vesicles and decreases during the
separation. The short-range repulsion plays an important role to avoid
particle collisions.

\ReviewerOne{Since the behavior of the suspended JP vesicles has similarities to the numerical 
results generated by using the algorithm adopted in \cite{qua-vee-you2019} (refer to all figure
insets in Figure~\ref{figure10} and Figure~\ref{figure12}). Figure~\ref{figure13} shows 
trajectory comparisons between the proposed model and the continuum modeling for both 
shear flow and extensional flow cases in two vesicle simulations. The quantity $d_{1,2}$
represents the distance between two centroids of JP vesicles. The centroid positions are 
identical for both models and the geometry in the continuum model is created along the 
midplane locations of JP vesicles and the initial reduced area is matched. Panel (a) shows that 
the results of continuum model does not have a periodic motion and two vesicles flow apart 
after 1.5 $\mu$s. Panel (b) shows that the results of continuum model has similar trend of
dynamics with one in the proposed model.}

\section{\label{conclusion}Conclusion}

\cite{Fu20} developed a mathematical model to quantify the macroscopic
assembly and mechanics of a JP vesicle in a viscous solvent. The
interactions between JP are formulated as a second-kind integral
equation, which is coupled to the Stokes equations for the surrounding
incompressible fluid at the zero-Reynolds-number limit. Numerical
simulations of a JP suspensions revealed self-assembly of JP into
micelles and bilayers, providing an alternative means for computing
mechanical moduli, which often requires the knowledge of an equation of
state from experiments on a colloidal
membrane~(\cite{Balchunas2019_SM}).
%
%This study presents a coarse-grained model for JP vesicles that focuses
%on the hydrophobic interactions between coarse-grained lipids and
%hydrodynamic interactions. In contrast to molecular dynamic simulations,
%the hydrophobic interactions exhibit the self-assembly property of the
%lipid bilayer membrane. The proposed energy potential combined with the
%mobility problem for rigid body motions captures membrane mechanics
%including deformations, stretching modulus, and permeability of a JP
%membrane. 
%
Results in this work show great potential to study Janus colloids~(\cite{Bradley2017,Mallory2017}) and the morphology of colloid
surfactants~(\cite{Bradley2016}). 
%
%This work is highly applicable with fields in material science
%and condensed matter physics such as Janus
%colloids~(\cite{Bradley2017,Mallory2017}) and the setup can be tuned to
%match experimental results such as the morphology of colloid
%surfactants~(\cite{Bradley2016}). 
%%
For example, with the flexibility of the model, we can specify the
boundary condition on JP surfaces based on the chemicals used in
experiments.
%This can be an assist to study of interparticle interactions and chemical compositions in industry.

%Integral equation methods are used to solve the mobility problem and the
%previously introduced HAP model. We describe a method to calculate the
%hydrophobic forces and torques on each individual rigid body that avoids
%singular integrals. In addition to the HAP forces and torques, we use a
%short-range repulsion to avoid unphysical contact. 

In the present study, we used this integral formulation and numerical
algorithm to simulate the hydrodynamics of JP vesicles in background
flows. Under a linear shear flow, we found a JP vesicle to exhibit
elongation and tank-treading dynamics observed for a lipid bilayer GUV.
%
%With the use of suitable parameters, the
%numerical results yield qualitative phenomena such as a tank-treading JP
%vesicle. 
%
The results showed that the reduced area $A^*$ decreases with shear rate
but that the total length of a JP vesicle is conserved. The decay rate
of the reduced area was independent of the shear rate values between
$0.003$~ns$^{-1}$ and~$0.005$~ns$^{-1}$. Moreover, the proposed model
describes membrane rupture in high shear rates. Therefore, our method
can be applied to vesicles undergoing topological changes which is
difficult to simulate when using a continuum model that represents
vesicles as closed and continuous curves.
%
%Our coarse-grained model is also able to calculate inter-monolayer
%friction. 
%

%
%Our method requires
%calculations of the hydrodynamic stress tensor, and these are used to
%
We estimated the inter-monolayer friction $b$, membrane permeability
constant $P$, and the membrane stretching modulus $K_A$. The
inter-monolayer friction coefficient was determined by calculating the
tangential shear force and slip velocities with respect to the bilayer
mid-plane. The range of friction coefficients agree with values reported
by~\cite{denOtter2007} in their MD study. The coarse-graining level of
the JP vesicle has a larger length scale than molecular dynamics
simulations, and in the future convergence studies we will investigate
how physical properties like the friction coefficient and membrane
permeability depend on the particle shape and size.

We also simulate the spatial migration of a JP vesicle in a parabolic
shear flow. 
%The chosen parameter values result in an asymmetric
%slipper shape. 
%
Replicating the hydrodynamics of a GUV in a Poiseuille
flow~(\cite{Kaoui09, dan-vla-mis2009, cou-kao-pod-mis2008}), the JP
vesicle moves toward the centre of the shear flow. While the initial
reduced area of the JP vesicle is $A^* \approx 1$, the equilibrium
reduced area is $A^*=0.9$. For the parameters we used in the simulation,
the JP vesicle takes on an asymmetric, ``slipper" shape as it settles
above the centre of flow and exhibits tank-treading motion.
%A qualitative
%agreement is made by comparing the JP vesicle shape with the
%two-dimensional inextensible membrane in continuum modeling
%simulations~(\cite{Kaoui09, dan-vla-mis2009, cou-kao-pod-mis2008}). 
An interesting result contrast with continuum results is that the JP
vesicle oscillates at a height slightly above the centre of the
Poiseuille flow. 

%The single JP vesicle simulations end with obtaining JP bilayer stretching 
%modulus $K_A$ and hydraulic permeability constant $P$. We extract these 
%physical quantities from the Laplace pressure relationship that $R\Delta P$ is 
%proportional to JP bilayer stretch. We describe the aqueous flux in membrane 
%using a differential equation~\ref{eq:perm} and solve for the theoretical 
%permeability constant $P$. In spite of producing these values with some discrepancy
%using the baseline parameter set, we provide a new framework in measuring coarse-grained 
%membrane permeability.

We further simulated the hydrodynamics of two JP vesicles, and drew
comparisons with simulation results of two vesicles described by the
Helfrich continuum model. A comparison of the vesicle shapes and the
streamlines demonstrate remarkable similarities. The two overlapping
trajectories of the JP vesicles' centroids in a shear flow evolve as
expected when the two centroids are initialized on the same horizontal
level. We also observe a rotating behaviour that is observed for models
involving vesicle adhesion~(\cite{qua-vee-you2019}). The hydrophobic
attraction led to this adhesive effect when two JP bilayers are
sufficiently close. We also performed several simulations of a pair of
JP vesicles suspended in an extensional flow. By varying the initial
vertical displacement of the vesicles' centroids, we can control for
divergent trajectories and obtain similar results to the continuum
model.

In \S~\ref{subsec:calculating_force}, we derived an alternative integral
form for calculating the force and torque to avoid the singular integral
evaluation. These alternative integrals allow us to accurately resolve
trajectories over long times without having to rely on computationally
expensive quadratures.

Our future goals include extending the current framework to a
three-dimensional JP vesicle system. This will require additional
algorithmic implementation including a fast summation method such as the
fast multipole method. Another research direction is to include the
fluctuating hydrodynamics for Brownian suspensions~(\cite{Bao2018}),
%introduce thermal fluctuations into the model. 
%This will result in Janus particles that include Brownian motion, 
and this is critical to understand membrane diffusion. Finally, a more
physical boundary conditions for the HAP model will allow us to draw
comparisons between computational and laboratory experiments.
