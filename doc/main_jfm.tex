\begin{abstract}
In this work, we study the dynamics of many-body systems immersed in a viscous fluid with a specified interparticle force. In particular, we apply a hydrophobic attraction potential (HAP) using a Janus type granular system to model lipid bilayer membranes. Coupling with an efficient integral equation method for rigid bodies in Stokes flow and an previous developed HAP solver, the deformations of a two-dimensional vesicle such as tank-treading motion and membrane ruptures can be observed under different values of the shear rate. Moreover, an efficient integral equation method is adopted for solving the screened Laplace equation and the mobility problem where it can accurately calculate hydrophobic and hydrodynamic interactions between near touched boundaries.

\subsection{Hydrophobic Attraction Potential (HAP)}


The Hydrophobic attraction potential (HAP) is given by
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:main}
\Phi(\Omega,f) = \gamma  \min_{u \in \mathcal{A}}
 I[u]  = \int_{\Omega} \rho |\nabla u|^2 + \rho^{-1} u^2 \,dx,
\end{equation}
%
where $\gamma$ the interfacial tension, $\rho$ the screened length, and this domain functional describes the energy associated with hydrophobic surfaces~\cite{Fu20}. From the first domain variation of HAP, we obtain a hydrophobic stress tensor which is given as follows, 

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:stress}
\mathbf{T}
= \gamma\rho^{-1}u^2 \mathbf{I} + 2\rho\gamma (\tfrac{1}{2}|\nabla u|^2 \mathbf{I} - \nabla u\otimes \nabla u).
\end{equation}
%
The integration over boundaries gives force and torque due to the hydrophobic attraction and they are given by 

\begin{equation}
\int_{\Gamma_i} {\bf T}\cdot \nu_i dS ,\quad \int_{\Gamma_i} ({\bf x}-{\bf a}_i)\times ({\bf T}\cdot \nu_i) dS,
\end{equation}
%
where ${\bf x}$ are points on the boundary $\Gamma_i$, ${\bf a}_i$ is the $i^{th}$ particle center, and $\nu_i$ is the outward normal to the $i^{th}$ particle.


%\begin{equation}
%        \label{SL}
%\begin{cases}
% -\rho^2 \Delta u + u =0 & \text{ in } \Omega,\\
%  u(x) = f(x)  &\text{ on }\Sigma, \\
%   u(x) \to 0, &\text{ as } x \to \infty.
%\end{cases}
%\end{equation}

\subsection{Nondimensionalizations}



For a two-dimensional vesicle, we denote a constant initial radius $R_0$ and 
the dimensionless shear rate is
\begin{equation}
\chi = \dot\gamma \cdot\frac{\mu R_0^2}{\kappa},
\end{equation}
%
where $\dot\gamma$ the shear rate, $\kappa$ the bending rigidity, and $\mu$ the fluid viscosity~\cite{Finken08}.


%This paper is organized as follows. Chapter 2 introduces the mobility problem..... The integral equation method for solving $N_b$-body system with details of .... are included in Chapter 3. We provide numerical results of vesicle simulations in Chapter 4. Finally, we conclude the work and briefly give the picture of our future work.


\section{\label{mobility}Mobility Problem}

The governing equation of $N_b$-body bodies suspended in the domain $\Sigma$ is
 
\begin{gather}
	-\Delta {\bf u} + \mu\nabla p = 0 \qquad \text{in }\Sigma\\
	\nabla\cdot {\bf u}=0 \qquad \text{in }\Sigma\\
	{\bf u}({\bf x}) \to {\bf u}_\infty \quad \text{as}\quad |{\bf x}|\to \infty
\end{gather}
%
where ${\bf u}$ is the velocity, $p$ is the pressure, and ${\bf u}_\infty$ is the background flow. 
%
%\begin{gather}
%\int_{\Gamma_i}(\sigma_{hyd}+\sigma_\infty)\cdot {\bf n} ds = -{\bf F}_i \\
%	\int_{\Gamma_i}(\sigma_{hyd}+\sigma_\infty)\times({\bf x}-{\bf a}_i)\cdot {\bf n} ds =-\tau_i\\
%\end{gather}
%
The mobility problem for $N_b$-body system in a Stokes flow leads to a second-kind boundary integral equations (BIE) with a density function $\eta({\bf x}$ that is given by \cite{Lukas19}
\begin{equation}
\label{mobility}
\begin{aligned}
{\bf v}_i + &\omega_i\times({\bf x}-{\bf a}_i)\\
 =& -\frac12\eta({\bf x}) + D[\eta]({\bf x}) \\
&+ \sum_{i=1}^N\big({\bf S}({\bf x}, {\bf a}_i){\bf F}_i+ {\bf R}({\bf x}, {\bf a}_i)t_i\big)+{\bf u}_\infty, \quad {\bf x}\in\Gamma \\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
%
with two constraints 
%
\begin{center}
\begin{equation}
\label{mobility2}
\int_{\partial \Gamma_i}\eta\cdot \nu ds = {\bf 0},
\end{equation}
\end{center}
%
\begin{center}
\begin{equation}
\label{mobility3}
\int_{\partial \Gamma_i}\eta\times({\bf x}-{\bf a}_i)\cdot \nu ds ={\bf 0},
\end{equation}
\end{center}
%
where the two-dimensional Stokeslet and the Rotlet are
%
\begin{gather}
{\bf S}({\bf x}, {\bf a}) = \frac{1}{4\pi}\left(-\log(|({\bf x}-{\bf a})|){\bf I}+\frac{({\bf x}-{\bf a})\otimes({\bf x}-{\bf a})}{|({\bf x}-{\bf a})|^2}\right) \\ 
{\bf R}({\bf x},{\bf a})=\frac{({\bf x}-{\bf a})^\perp}{4\pi|({\bf x}-{\bf a})|^2}.
\end{gather}
%
%Here ${\bf r}={\bf x}-{\bf a}$ and $\rho=|{\bf r}|$.
${\bf F}_i$ and $t_i$ are particle force and torque calculated from action of hydrophobic attractions. From equations~\eqref{mobility}--\eqref{mobility3}, we have translational velocity ${\bf v}_i$, angular velocity $\omega_i$, and density function $\eta$ as unknowns.
This system of equations is then solvable with the use of an iterative method such as GMRES or conjugate gradient iterations.

\section{\label{IEM}Integral Equation Method}



\subsection{Short Range Repulsion}

At each time step, we examine the nearest grid points between each pair of body  boundaries. Within a specified distance $d$, we introduce a short range repulsive potential as follows

\begin{equation}
\Phi_{repul} = 1- \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2} d\right).
\end{equation}

Here we would like to make a remark about the time marching scheme. From the mobility problem, we obtain velocity and torque profiles of an $N_b$-body system. A second order Adam-Bashforth scheme is used for updating the dynamics but body collisions may occur during the simulation while a relatively large time step is chosen. We therefore impose a short range repulsion that it will be turned on when the distance between two boundary points on different bodies are within one characteristic length.


\section{\label{results}Numerical Results}

\subsection{Single Particle Validations}

The preliminary test of the proposed numerical algorithm is the Jeffery orbits of single ellipsoidal particle under a shear flow. A particle is initially placed with its center of mass fixed at the origin and the angle between the major axis and the $y$-axis is $\chi = 0^\circ$. Based on the theoretical Jeffery orbits, 

\begin{equation}
\chi = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{a}{b}\left(\tan \frac{ab \dot\gamma t}{a^2+b^2}\right)\right),
\end{equation}
%
where $a$, $b$ are semi-major and semi-minor axes, $\dot\gamma$ is the shear rate, and the test aspect ration of the particle is $2$. Figure~\ref{figure1} shows that the proposed integral equation method has a perfect agreement with the theoretical result from Jeffery orbits.

\end{center}
  \caption{Comparison of the target angle $\chi(t)$ versus time $t$ between the theoretical Jeffery orbit and the result from the integral equation method.
  }
    \label{figure1}
\end{figure}



\subsection{Tank-Treading Vesicles}

To study the deformation of the bilayer structure under a shear flow using the proposed algorithm, 
we adopt the widely tested numerical simulations in both continuum and molecular dynamics models.
Given a set of various shear rates, with no viscosity difference between internal and external fluids, 
the vesicle-like granular structure is initially placed in a quiescent flow for obtaining an equilibrium shape.

%We tune the shear rates, vesicle sizes and .....

%Theoretical tank-treading frequency is given by $\dot\gamma/2$.

%We also compare the inclination angle against the Jeffery's equation [].






\subsection{Membrane Ruptures}

With the choice of a large shear rate, a pore formation or a complete membrane rupture can be observed during simulations. 



\subsection{Two Vesicles in a Linear Flow}


Figure~\ref{figure3} shows two sets of simulations. Starting from the initial configuration (shown in panel (a)), panels (b)-(d) show the transitions of two vesicles moving under an extensional flow. The flow is stretching along the $y$ direction and squeezing in $x$ direction. Hence two vesicles are first pushed toward each other  then separate. With the same starting state, panels (e)-(h) are the observed phenomena when two vesicles are in a shear flow $x = \dot\gamma y$. An interesting event occurs in the simulation that a rotational behavior with an adhesive effect can be observed and tuned.

\section{Appendices}
The stress ${\bf T}$ contains the gradient of the double layer potential. This 
introduces an inherent difficulty in evaluating stress on the boundary.
To overcome the difficulty of evaluation on $\Sigma_p$, for instance, we decompose $u$ into singular and nonsingular parts:
\begin{equation}
u = u_p + v_p
\end{equation}
where  
\begin{equation}
u_p(x) = \int_{\Sigma_p} \frac{\partial G(x,y)}{\partial \nu} \eta(y) \,\dif S(y).
\end{equation}
It turns out that the contribution to the force and torque coming from the singular
part vanishes. In particular, we will prove the identity
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:recipforcetorque}
F_p + iG_p= \int_{\Sigma_p} \gamma ({\bf I}+i{\bf X})J_{p} \,\dif S
\end{equation}
where
 \begin{equation}
\label{eq:jumpstress1}
J_{p} = 2\rho^{-1} \eta  v_p \nu 
+ 2\rho \nabla \eta \cdot \tau_i(\nabla v_p \cdot \tau_i \nu -  \nabla v_p \cdot \nu \tau_i).
\end{equation}
Here $\nu$ is the unit normal, $\{\tau_i\}_{i=1}^2$ are orthonormal tangent vectors,
and ${\bf X}$ is the skew symmetric matrix with axial vector $x$, i.e.
\[X_{ij} = \varepsilon_{ikj}x_k,\quad {\bf X}v = x\times v\]
where $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}$ is the third-order alternating tensor.
We employ the Einstein summation convention and use complex vectors to streamline the presentation, $i^2 = -1$.

The benefit of using \eqref{eq:recipforcetorque} is that the integrand  is nonsingular.
The density function $\eta$ has the same smoothness as the boundary data
and $v_p$ is real-analytic in a neighborhood of $\Sigma_p$.

To prove \eqref{eq:recipforcetorque}, write
\begin{align*}
  {\bf T}
  &=
  \sigma[u_p,u_p]
  +(\sigma[u_p,v_p]
  +\sigma[v_p,u_p])
  +\sigma[v_p,v_p] \\
  &= {\bf T}_1 + {\bf T}_2 + {\bf T}_3
\end{align*}
where
\[
\sigma[u,v]
= \rho^{-1} uv {\bf I} + \rho \nabla u \cdot \nabla v {\bf I} - 2 \rho \nabla u \otimes \nabla v.
\]
\begin{lemma}
  \label{eq:stress_div_lemma}
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:decompdivfree}
    \nabla \cdot {\bf T}_j = 0, \quad
    \nabla \cdot (x \times {\bf T}_j) = 0,\quad j = 1, 2, 3.
  \end{equation}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Observe that
  \begin{align*}
    (\nabla \cdot {\bf T})_j &=
    \nabla_k   T_{jk} \\
    &= \rho^{-1} 2u \nabla_j u + \rho(2\nabla_{kl}^2 u \nabla_l u  - 2 \nabla_{kj}^2 u \nabla_k u
    - 2 \nabla_j u \nabla_{kk}^2 u )\\
    &=2\rho^{-1}(-\rho^2 \Delta u + u)\nabla_k u .
  \end{align*}
  However, $-\rho^2 \Delta u + u = 0$ and so we get $\nabla \cdot {\bf T} = 0.$
  Furthermore,
  \begin{align*}
    (\nabla \cdot (x\times {\bf T} ))_j
    &= (\nabla \cdot ({\bf X} {\bf T} ))_j
    = \nabla_k (X_{jl} T_{lk})
    = \nabla_k (\epsilon_{jml}x_m T_{lk})\\
    &= \varepsilon_{jml} T_{lm} + \varepsilon_{jml}x_m \nabla_k T_{lk}\\
    &= (\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}:{\bf T} + {\bf x} \times \nabla \cdot {\bf T})_j.
  \end{align*}
  Since ${\bf T}$ is symmetric $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}:{\bf T} = {\bf 0}$, and we get
  $\nabla \cdot (x \times {\bf T}) = 0$ as well.

  The functions $u_p$ and $v_p$ also solve the equation $-\rho^2 \Delta u + u = 0$.  Thus
  \eqref{eq:decompdivfree} holds for $j = 1, 3$. Finally,
  \eqref{eq:decompdivfree} holds for $j = 2$ because
  ${\bf T}_2 = {\bf T} - {\bf T}_1 - {\bf T}_3$.
\end{proof}


Using Lemma \ref{eq:stress_div_lemma}, we will establish that
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:prejump}
  F_p + i G_p = \gamma \int_{\Sigma_p}  ({\bf U}_2\nu)^+ - ({\bf U}_2\nu)^-\,\dif S
\end{equation}
where ${\bf U}_j = ({\bf I} + i {\bf X}){\bf T}_j$ for $j = 1, 2, 3.$
The stress ${\bf U}_2$ has a jump discontinuity at $\Sigma_p.$
The plus and minus superscripts denote
the limit taken along points in $U_p^c$ and along points in $U_p$
respectively.
${\bf U}_1$ and ${\bf U}_3$ are real-analytic in a neighborhood of $\overline{U_p}$
and have no jump-discontinuity at $\Sigma_p$.
To derive \eqref{eq:prejump}, we expand
\begin{align*}
  F_p + i G_p
  &= \gamma \int_{\Sigma_p} {\bf T} \nu + ix \times {\bf T} \nu \,\dif S \\
  &= \gamma \int_{\Sigma_p}  {\bf U}_1\nu  + ({\bf U}_2\nu)^+ + {\bf U}_3\nu\,\dif S
\end{align*}
The function $u_p$ is real-analytic and
$\nabla \cdot {\bf U}_1 = 0$ throughout $\mathbb{R}^n \setminus U_p$.
By the divergence theorem, we get
\begin{equation*}
  \int_{\Sigma_p}  {\bf U}_1 \nu\,\dif S
  = \int_{\mathbb{R}^n \setminus U_p} \nabla \cdot {\bf U}_1 \,dx = 0.
\end{equation*}
Next, $v_p$ is real-analytic and
$\nabla \cdot {\bf U}_3 = 0$ in $U_p$. Therefore
\begin{equation*}
  \int_{\Sigma_p}  {\bf U}_3 \nu\,\dif S
  = -\int_{U_p} \nabla \cdot {\bf U}_3 \,dx = 0.
\end{equation*}
Finally, $\nabla \cdot {\bf U}_2= 0$ in $U_p$. This gives
\[
0 = -\int_{U_p} \nabla \cdot {\bf U}_2 \,dx = \int_{\Sigma_p}  ({\bf U}_2 \nu)^-\,\dif S.
\]
Combining the last four equations give \eqref{eq:prejump}.

\begin{proof}[Proof of \eqref{eq:recipforcetorque}]
  The main ingredients of the proof are the jump relations
  for $u_p$. For $x_0 \in \Sigma_p$,
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $ \lim_{x \to x_0^\pm } u_p(x) = \pm\frac{1}{2}\eta(x_0) + (D\eta)(x_0)$
  \item $ \lim_{x \to x_0^+ } (\nabla u_p \cdot \nu) (x) = \lim_{x \to x_0^-} (\nabla u \cdot \nu)(x)$
  \end{enumerate}
  Furthermore,
  combining (i) and (ii) gives
  \begin{align*}
    \nabla u_p^+ - \nabla u_p^-
    &= \nabla (u_p^+ - u_p^-) \cdot t_i t_i +  (\nabla  u_p^+\cdot \nu  - \nabla u_p^- \cdot \nu) \nu\\
    &= \nabla \eta \cdot \tau_i \tau_i
  \end{align*}
  where $\{\tau_i\}_{i=1}^n$ are an orthonormal tangent vectors.
  We can use these relationships to derive an expression for the jump in
  normal stress.
  \begin{align*}
    &({\bf T}_2\nu)^+ - ({\bf T}_2\nu)^-
    \\
    &= 2\rho^{-1} u_p^+v_p \nu + 2\rho \nabla u_p^+ \cdot \nabla v_p \nu
    - 2 \rho \nabla u_p^+  \nabla v_p \cdot \nu
    - 2 \rho \nabla v_p  \nabla u_p^+ \cdot \nu\\
    &-2\rho^{-1} u_p^-v_p \nu - 2\rho \nabla u_p^- \cdot \nabla v_p \nu
    + 2 \rho \nabla u_p^-  \nabla v_p \cdot \nu
    + 2 \rho \nabla v_p  \nabla u_p^- \cdot \nu\\
    &= 2\rho^{-1} \eta v_p \nu + 2\rho \nabla \eta \cdot \tau_i \tau_i \cdot \nabla v_p \nu
    - 2\rho \nabla \eta \cdot \tau_i \tau_i \nabla v_p \cdot \nu + 0\\
    &= J_p.
  \end{align*}

  Applying the above relations to the integrand of \eqref{eq:prejump} yields
  \[
  ({\bf U}_2\nu)^+ - ({\bf U}_2\nu)^-
  =
  ({\bf I} + i {\bf X})(({\bf T}_2\nu)^+ - ({\bf T}_2\nu)^-)
  = ({\bf I} + i {\bf X})J_p
  \]
  This completes the proof of \eqref{eq:recipforcetorque}.
