\begin{abstract}
  In this work, we study the dynamics of many-body systems immersed in a
  viscous fluid with a specified interparticle force. In particular, we
  apply a hydrophobic attraction potential (HAP) using a Janus type
  granular system to model lipid bilayer membranes. Coupling with an
  efficient integral equation method for rigid bodies in Stokes flow and
  a previous developed HAP solver, the deformations of a two-dimensional
  vesicle such as tank-treading motion and membrane ruptures can be
  observed under different values of the shear rate. Moreover, an
  efficient integral equation method is adopted for solving the screened
  Laplace equation and the mobility problem where it can accurately
  calculate hydrophobic and hydrodynamic interactions between near
  touched boundaries.

\section{\label{intro}Introduction}
Described by de Gennes as ``another animal in soft matter physics", the
Janus particle (often a spherical particle with a hydrophobic and a
hydrophilic hemisphere) exhibits complex aggregate, clustering, and
self-assembly into mesoscopic and macroscopic structures that are
relevant to a wide range of applications in biology and bioengineering.
Whether it is surface chemistry or polarity under an external field, the
dynamics of Janus particles is inevitably the combination of long-range
hydrodynamics interactions in the presence of short- and
intermediate-range particle-particle interactions. Recently~\cite{Fu20}
illustrated that the hydrophobic interactions between Janus particles in
a viscous solvent can be used as a coarse-grained model to capture the
mechanics of an elastic bilayer membrane of amphiphilic macromolecules
such as lipids. Depending on the total number of Janus particles and
their geometry, in a viscous solvent, Janus particles can aggregate to
form a micelle, a patch of bilayer membrane with open ends, and a
self-enclosed bilayer membrane (referred to as a Janus-vesicle). Using a
hybrid continuum model for the interactions between amphiphilic
particles in a viscous solvent and formulating it in a boundary integral
formulation,~\cite{Fu20} showed that the membrane granularity during
fusion and fission of bilayers can be accurately captured. 
%This boundary integral formulation has inspired more recent work

In molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, the lipid bilayer membranes are
often approximated by an implicit solvent coarse-grained model for
lipids (as in the Martini code), where their hydrodynamic interactions
are simplified by an implicit solvent. The long-range hydrodynamic
interactions and the induced long-range lipid interactions can be
captured by combining the Dry Martini with a lattice Boltzmann MD.
\cite{Brandner2019} used this methodology to simulate the hydrodynamics
of a nano-sized vesicle under a shear flow, and reproduced the well-know
vesicle hydrodynamics such as tank-treading, tumbling, and inter-leaflet
slippage (reported from simulations of the Helfrich-type continuum
model).

In this work we extend the hybrid continuum model in~\cite{Fu20} for the
Janus suspension to incorporate the collective hydrodynamics of a Janus
suspension under various flows: a linear shear flow, an elongation flow,
and a Poiseuille flow. We demonstrate that a Janus-vesicle behaves like
a vesicle in these flowing conditions. In particular, we show that a
Janus-vesicle undergoes tank-treading in a shear flow and vertical
migration in a channel flow. Furthermore we use the hybrid continuum
model to investigate the inter-leaflet slippage and rupture of a bilayer
membrane due to an imposed flow. Finally, we compare a pair of
interacting Janus-vesicles with a continuum model of a pair of vesicles.

We require a numerical method to avoid unphysical contact between rigid
Janus particles. Optimization-based contact methods introduce
constraints, such as enforcing a non-positive space-time interference
volume (\cite{lu-rah-zor2017, Lukas19, yan-cor-mal-vee-she2020}), which
guarantee that the suspension remains contact-free. These methods do not
introduce stiffness, but potentially expensive nonlinear complementarity
problems must be solved at each time step.  Repulsion-based contact
methods, which we employ, introduce an artificial repulsion force that
increases in strength as two particles approach one another
(\cite{glo-pan-hes-jos-per2001, fen-mic2004, kab-qua-bir2018}). Strong
repulsion forces can introduce numerical stiffness, but with the
presence of the hydrophobic forces, we maintain a contact-free
suspensions with a relatively weak non-stiff repulsive force.

This paper is organized as follows. In \S~\ref{sec:governing_eqs} we
present the formulation for the Janus particles in a viscous fluid in
the zero-Reynolds number regime. In \S~\ref{sec:IEM} we extend the
hybrid continuum model for a Janus suspension to include the effects of
a far-field flow via the mobility problem formulation. In
\S~\ref{validation} we present validation of our model, and in
\S~\ref{results} we present simulation results for a single and pair of
Janus-vesicles under various flowing conditions. Finally we provide
discussion and outlook for future directions in \S~\ref{conclusion}.

\section{Governing Equations\label{sec:governing_eqs}}
\subsection{\label{mobility}Mobility Problem}
We consider an $N_b$-many body collection of particles suspended in a
two-dimensional unbounded domain $\Omega$. The boundary of each particle
is denoted by $\Gamma_i$ so that $\bd \Omega = \Gamma_1 \cup \Gamma_2
\cup \cdots \cup \Gamma_{N_b}$ and $\nnu_i$ is the particle outward
normal. Assuming the inertial terms are negligible, the governing
equations are
\begin{alignat}{3}
  -\mu \Delta \uu + \nabla p &= \mathbf{0}, 
    && \xx \in \Omega, \\
  \nabla\cdot \uu &= 0, \qquad && \xx \in \Omega, \\
  \uu - \uu_\infty &\to \mathbf{0}, && |\xx| \to \infty,
\end{alignat}
%
where $\uu$ is the velocity, $\mu$ is viscosity, $p$ is the pressure,
and $\uu_\infty$ is the background flow. Since each particle $\Gamma_i$
with center $\aa_i$ is a rigid body, its velocity satisfies 
\begin{align}
  \vv(\xx) = \vv_i + \omega_i (\xx - \aa_i)^\perp, \quad 
    \xx \in \Gamma_i,
\end{align}
where $\vv_i$ is its translational velocity and $\omega_i$ is its
angular velocity. Here, $\langle x, y \rangle^{\perp} = \langle -y, x
\rangle$. Therefore, the no-slip boundary condition on each particle is
\begin{align}
  \uu(\xx) = \vv_i + \omega_i (\xx - \aa_i)^\perp, \quad
    \xx \in \Gamma_i.
\end{align}
To determine the translational and angular velocities of each particle,
we define imposed forces $\FF_i$ and torques $T_i$ acting on each
particle. Since the small particles are intertialess, force balance
gives 
\begin{alignat}{2}
  \label{eq:force}
  \FF_i &+ \int_{\Gamma_i} \ssigma \cdot \nnu_i \, \dif s = \mathbf{0},
  && i=1,\ldots,N_b,\\
  \label{eq:torque}
  T_i &+ \int_{\Gamma_i} (\xx - \aa_i)^\perp \cdot 
    (\ssigma \cdot \nnu_i) \, \dif s = 0, \qquad && i=1,\ldots,N_b,
\end{alignat}
where $\ssigma = -p \mathbf{I} + \mu \left(\nabla \uu + \nabla \uu^T
\right)$ is the hydrodynamic stress tensor (pressure tensor).
The process of finding the translational and angular velocities given a
force and torque is referred to as the mobility problem.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Imposed Forces}
The imposed forces and torques contain two parts. The first part comes
from the hydrophobic attraction potential (HAP). This potential was
introduced in~\cite{Fu20} and models hydrophobic attraction by solving
the screened Laplace equation boundary value problem
\begin{alignat}{2}
  \label{eq:SL}
-\rho^2 \Delta u + u &=0,            && \xx \in \Omega,\\
\label{eq:SLbc}
u(\xx) &= f_i(\xx),\qquad  && \xx \in \Gamma_i, \\
\label{eq:SLff}
u &\to 0,                          &&|\xx| \to \infty,
\end{alignat}
where $0 \leq f_i \leq 1$ is a material label with $f_i = 0$, respectively $1$, representing
hydrophilic, respectively hydrophobic, portions of the surface.  We assume that the $f_i$ and $\Gamma_i$ are
smooth.  The parameter $\rho$ is the
decay length of attraction. The forces and torques for this attraction
are 
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:hydrophobicAttraction}
  \FF_i^{\text{hydro}} = \int_{\Gamma_i} {\bf T}\cdot \nnu_i \, \dif s, 
    \quad 
  T_i^{\text{hydro}} = \int_{\Gamma_i} (\xx - \aa_i)^{\perp} \cdot ({\bf T} \cdot \nnu_i) \dif s,
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:stress}
\mathbf{T}
= \gamma\rho^{-1}u^2 \mathbf{I} + 2\rho\gamma \left(\tfrac{1}{2}|\nabla
  u|^2 \mathbf{I} - \nabla u  \nabla u^T\right)
\end{align}
is the hydrophobic stress tensor. The parameter $\gamma$ is interfacial
tension. The forces $\FF_i^{\text{hydro}}$ and torques
$T_i^{\text{hydro}}$ are responsible for forming particle aggregates
that partially sequester the hydrophobic portions of the particle
surface.

The second part of the imposed forces and torques comes from repulsion
between proximal particles. Given a pair particles indexed with $i$ and
$j$, we find the two points $\tilde{\xx}_i \in \Gamma_i$ and
$\tilde{\xx}_j \in \Gamma_j$ that are closest to one another. We then
define the repulsion force and torque
\begin{align}
%  \label{eq:REPUL}
%  \FF_i^{\text{repul}} = \sum_{i=1}^{N_b} \frac{\xx_{ij} -
%  \yy_{ij}}{\rho_{ij}} P(\rho_{ij}),\quad 
%  T_i^{\text{repul}} = \sum_{i=1}^{N_b} (\xx_{ij} - \aa_i)^{\perp}\cdot
%  \frac{\xx_{ij} - \yy_{ij}}{\rho_{ij}} P(\rho_{ij})
%  \\
%
  \label{eq:REPULforce}
  \FF_i^{\text{repul}} &= \sum_{j \neq i} 
    \frac{\tilde{\xx}_i - \tilde{\xx}_j}
    {|\tilde{\xx}_i - \tilde{\xx}_j|} 
    P'(|\tilde{\xx}_i - \tilde{\xx}_j|), \\
  \label{eq:REPULtorque}
  T_i^{\text{repul}} &= \sum_{j \neq i} 
    (\tilde{\xx}_i - \aa_i)^{\perp} \cdot 
    \frac{\tilde{\xx}_i - \tilde{\xx}_j}
    {|\tilde{\xx}_i - \tilde{\xx}_j|} 
    P'(|\tilde{\xx}_i - \tilde{\xx}_j|).
\end{align}
The repulsion profile $P(r)$ is zero for distances $r$ larger than a
repulsion length scale $\rho_0$. As such,~\eqref{eq:REPULforce}
and~\eqref{eq:REPULtorque} ignore particles $\Gamma_j$ outside a
tubular neighborhood of $\Gamma_i$. For $0 \leq r < \rho_0,$ we use
$P(r) = M(1 - \sin(r/\rho_0))$ where $M$ is sufficiently large to
prevent particle collisions. Then, the total imposed force and torque
are
\begin{align}
  \FF_i = \FF_i^{\text{hydro}} + \FF_i^{\text{repul}},\quad
  T_i = T_i^{\text{hydro}} + T_i^{\text{repul}}, \qquad
  i=1,\ldots,N_b.
\end{align}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Time Marching}
By solving the mobility problem, we obtain translational and angular
velocities of the $N_b$-body system. A second-order Adams-Bashforth
scheme updates the particle positions and orientations. By including the
repulsion force~\eqref{eq:REPULforce} and
torque~\eqref{eq:REPULtorque}, particle collisions are avoided even
when using a relatively large time step. 



%This paper is organized as follows. Chapter 2 introduces the mobility problem..... The integral equation method for solving $N_b$-body system with details of .... are included in Chapter 3. We provide numerical results of vesicle simulations in Chapter 4. Finally, we conclude the work and briefly give the picture of our future work.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Integral Equation Method}
\label{sec:IEM}
Computing the hydrophobic attraction potential and the particle forces
and torques requires the solution of elliptic partial differential
equations (PDEs) in an unbounded complex domain. We recast both these
PDEs as boundary integral equations (BIEs). We discretize each BIE at
$N$ points on each of the $N_b$ particles with a collocation method.
Integrals that are smooth are computed with the spectrally-accurate
quadrature rule, and nearly-singular integrals, caused by close contact
between two particles, are computed with a high-order
interpolation-based quadrature rule~\cite{qua-bir2014}. After
discretizing and applying quadrature, the resulting linear system is
solved with matrix-free GMRES, and we guarantee that the number of GMRES
iterations is mesh-independent by using second-kind BIEs.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{HAP Boundary Integral Equation}
Similar to our previous work~\cite{Fu20}, we represent the HAP as a
double-layer potential
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:HAP_DLP}
  u(\xx) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{\bd\Omega} \pderiv{}{\nnu_\yy}
    K_0 \left(\frac{|\xx - \yy|}{\rho}\right) \sigma(\yy) \, \dif s_\yy,
    \quad \xx \in \mathbb{R}^2,
\end{align}
where $K_0$ is the zeroth-order modified Bessel function of the first
kind and the integral is taken in the sense of principle value whenever $\xx \in \partial \Omega$. 
By requiring that the density function $\sigma$ satisfies the
second-kind integral equation
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:screenedSKIE}
  f(\xx) = \frac{1}{2}\sigma(\xx) + 
    \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{\bd\Omega} \pderiv{}{\nnu_\yy}
    K_0 \left(\frac{|\xx - \yy|}{\rho}\right) \sigma(\yy) \, \dif s_\yy,
    \quad \xx \in \bd\Omega,
\end{equation}
the HAP double-layer potential~\eqref{eq:HAP_DLP} satisfies the screened
Laplace equation~\eqref{eq:SL}--\eqref{eq:SLff}. We
solve~\eqref{eq:screenedSKIE} with a collocation method. The integrals
are approximated with either the trapezoid rule or with the
interpolation-based near-singular integration scheme. This results in a
$NN_b \times NN_b$ linear system that is solved with a block-diagonal
preconditioned GMRES solver.

To calculate the hydrophobic force and torque, the gradient of the
double-layer potential~\eqref{eq:HAP_DLP} must be computed on the
boundary of each particle. In Section~\ref{subsec:calculating_force}, we
show that the force and torque calculations can be expressed in terms of
non-singular integrals.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Mobility Problem Boundary Integral Equation}
Following previous work of~\cite{Lukas19}, we represent the velocity as
the sum of a double-layer potential and $N_b$ Stokeslets and Rotlets
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:velocity}
  \uu(\xx) = \uu_\infty(\xx) + \DD[\eeta](\xx) + 
    \sum_{i=1}^{N_b} \left(\SS(\xx,\aa_i) \FF_i + 
    \RR(\xx,\aa_i) T_i\right), \quad \xx \in \Omega.
\end{align}
The double-layer potential is
\begin{align}
  \DD[\eeta](\xx) = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_{\bd\Omega} 
    \frac{\rr \cdot \nnu}{\rho^2} \frac{\rr \otimes \rr}{\rho^2}
    \eeta(\yy) \, \dif s_\yy,
\end{align}
where $\rr = \xx - \yy$ and $\rho = |\rr|$. The Stokeslet and Rotlet
centered at $\aa_i$ are
\begin{align}
  \SS(\xx,\aa_i)\FF_i &= \frac{1}{4\pi} \left(-\log \rho + 
    \frac{\rr \otimes \rr}{\rho^2}\right) \FF_i, \\
  \RR(\xx,\aa_i)T_i &= \frac{1}{4\pi} \frac{\rr^\perp}{\rho^2} T_i,
\end{align}
where $\rr = \xx - \aa_i$ and $\rho = |\rr|$. The Stokeslet is
torque-free and has force $\FF_i$ while the Rotlet is force-free and has
torque $T_i$. Therefore, the velocity~\eqref{eq:velocity} satisfies the
total force~\eqref{eq:force} and torque~\eqref{eq:torque} conditions
if the double-layer potential $\DD[\eeta]$ is force- and torque-free.
Matching the limit of~\eqref{eq:velocity} with the rigid body motion,
and imposing that $\DD[\eeta]$ is force- and torque-free, the density
function $\eeta$, translational velocity $\vv_i$, and angular velocity
$\omega_i$ satisfy
\begin{alignat}{3}
  \nonumber
  \vv_i + \omega_i (\xx - \aa_i)^\perp &= \uu_\infty(\xx)
    -\frac{1}{2} \eeta(\xx) + \DD[\eeta](\xx) \\
  \label{eq:SKIE}
    + \sum_{j=1}^{N_b} &
    \left(\SS(\xx,\aa_j) \FF_j + \RR(\xx,\aa_j) T_j\right),
    \quad &&\xx \in \Gamma_i,\: i=1,\ldots,N_b, \\
  \label{eq:mobility1}
  \int_{\bd\Gamma_i} \eeta \cdot \nnu_i \, \dif s &= {\bf 0}, 
  &&i = 1,\ldots,N_b, \\
  \label{eq:mobility2}
  \int_{\bd\Gamma_i} \eeta\times(\xx-\aa_i)^\perp \cdot \nnu_i \, \dif s &= 0,
  &&i = 1,\ldots,N_b.
\end{alignat}

The trapezoid rule is used to approximate the integrals in
equations~\eqref{eq:mobility1} and~\eqref{eq:mobility2}, and the
double-layer potential equation~\eqref{eq:SKIE} is approximated with
either the trapezoid rule, or the interpolation-based near-singular
integration scheme. After discretizing and applying appropriate
quadrature rules, the result is a $(2NN_b + 3N_b) \times (2NN_b + 3N_b)$
linear system that we precondition with a block-diagonal preconditioner.
We note that other BIE formulations of the mobility problem use
single-layer potentials (\cite{cor-gre-rac-vee2017, rac-gre2016}) or a
combination of single- and double-layer potentials (\cite{cor-vee2018}).

We validated our solver for \eqref{eq:SKIE}-\eqref{eq:mobility2} using a single elliptical particle 
is suspended in a background shear flow; see Section \ref{sec:ves_in_shear}.
Hydrophobic attraction and repulsion are zero for a single particle. 
The angle of the ellipse's major axis coming from the integral equation method was in complete agreement 
with the theoretical, Jeffrey oribit time-course \cite{}. 
  
%The Jeffrey orbit  
%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:jeff}
%\Theta(t) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{a}{b}\tan \left(\frac{ab \dot\gamma t}{a^2+b^2}\right)\right)
%\end{equation}
%gives the angle between the major axis and $\mathbf{e}_2$
%where $a$, $b$ are the semi-major and semi-minor axes. 
%We are assuming $\Theta(0) = 0$.
% 

%The background flow is a shear flow $\uu_{\infty}(\xx) = \dot\gamma  \xx \cdot \mathbf{e}_2 \mathbf{e}_1$ with shear rate $\dot\gamma$
%and orthogonal unit vectors $\mathbf{e}_1$ and $\mathbf{e}_2$. 
%A single elliptical particle is suspended in the fluid with center at the origin.
%The Jeffrey orbit  
%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:jeff}
%\Theta(t) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{a}{b}\tan \left(\frac{ab \dot\gamma t}{a^2+b^2}\right)\right)
%\end{equation}
%gives the angle between the major axis and $\mathbf{e}_2$
%where $a$, $b$ are the semi-major and semi-minor axes. 
%We are assuming $\Theta(0) = 0$.
%Figure~\ref{figure1} shows that the angles coming from the integral equation method \eqref{eq:SKIE}-\eqref{eq:mobility2}
%are in complete agreement with the theoretical time course \eqref{eq:jeff}.  Hydrophobic attraction and repulsion are zero for a single particle. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Calculating the Hydrophobic Force}
\label{subsec:calculating_force}
Once \eqref{eq:SKIE} has been solved for $\sigma$, we need to evaluate
the integrals~\eqref{eq:hydrophobicAttraction}. These integrals involve
the stress \eqref{eq:stress} which contains a singular integral for the
gradient of the double-layer potential. To avoid singular integrals, we
evaluate \eqref{eq:hydrophobicAttraction} using the identities
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:recipforcetorque}
  \FF_i^{\text{hydro}} = \int_{\Gamma_i} \JJ_i \,\dif s,\quad
  T_i^{\text{hydro}}    = \int_{\Gamma_i} 
    (\xx - \aa_i)^{\perp} \cdot \JJ_i  \,\dif s,
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:jumpstress1}
  \JJ_{i} = 2\gamma\rho^{-1} \sigma v_i \nnu + 
    2\gamma\rho \frac{d\sigma}{ds} \frac{dv_i}{ds} \nnu -
    2\gamma\rho \frac{d\sigma}{ds} \frac{dv_i}{d\nu} \ttau.
\end{align}
Here, $\ttau$ and $\frac{d}{ds}$ are the unit tangent  and arc length
derivative for $\Gamma_i$, respectively, and
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:uidef}
\begin{aligned}
    u(\xx) &= u_i(\xx) + v_i(\xx),\\
    u_i(\xx) &= \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{\Gamma_i} \pderiv{}{\nnu_\yy}
    K_0 \left(\frac{|\xx - \yy|}{\rho}\right) \sigma(\yy) \, \dif s_\yy,
    \quad \xx \in \mathbb{R}^2.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
That is, $v_i(\xx)$ is the double-layer potential~\eqref{eq:HAP_DLP} with 
$\Gamma_i$ excluded from $\bd\Omega$. The advantage in
using \eqref{eq:recipforcetorque} over using \eqref{eq:hydrophobicAttraction} is that the components
$\sigma$, $v_i$, $\frac{d\sigma}{ds}$, and $\frac{dv_i}{ds}$ of $\JJ_i$ are smooth functions,
whereas the components of \eqref{eq:stress} are singular integrals.  

To prove \eqref{eq:recipforcetorque}, let 
\begin{align*}
  {\bf T} &=
    \mathbf{S}(u_i,u_i)
  +(\mathbf{S}(u_i,v_i)
  +\mathbf{S}(v_i,u_i))
  +\mathbf{S}(v_i,v_i) \\
  &= {\bf T}_1 + {\bf T}_2 + {\bf T}_3
\end{align*}
where we introduce the bilinear form
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Tsplit}
\mathbf{S}(u,v)
=  \gamma\rho^{-1} uv {\bf I} + \gamma\rho \nabla u \cdot \nabla v {\bf I} - 2 \gamma \rho \nabla u \nabla v^T .
\end{equation}
Using the fact that $u$,  $u_i$, and $v_i$ solve the screened Laplace
equation~\eqref{eq:SL},  and that $\mathbf{T}$, $\mathbf{T}_j$, $j = 1,
2, 3$ are symmetric, it is straightforward to verify that 
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:decompdivfree}
    \nabla \cdot {\bf T}_j = 0, \quad
    \nabla \cdot ((\xx-\aa_i)^{\perp} \cdot {\bf T}_j) = 0, \quad j = 1, 2, 3.
  \end{equation}

%\begin{lemma}
%  \label{eq:stress_div_lemma}
%  \begin{equation}
%    \label{eq:decompdivfree}
%    \nabla \cdot {\bf T}_j = 0, \quad
%    \nabla \cdot (\xx^{\perp} \cdot {\bf T}_j) = 0
%  \end{equation}
% for  $ j = 1, 2, 3$.
%\end{lemma}
%\begin{proof}
%  Let $\mathbf{T}$ be as in \eqref{eq:stress}.  
%  It is straightforward to show that  
%%  \begin{align*}
% %   (\nabla \cdot {\bf T})_j &=
% %   \nabla_k   T_{jk}  = 0\\
% %   &= \rho^{-1} 2u \nabla_j u + \rho(2\nabla_{kl}^2 u \nabla_l u  - 2 \nabla_{kj}^2 u \nabla_k u
% %  - 2 \nabla_j u \nabla_{kk}^2 u )\\
% %   &=2\rho^{-1}(-\rho^2 \Delta u + u)\nabla_j u = 0,
% % \end{align*}
% \begin{equation*}
%\nabla \cdot {\bf T} = 2\rho^{-1}(-\rho^2 \Delta u + u)\nabla u = 0
% \end{equation*}

Let $U_i$ be the interior of the particle indexed by $i$. For $\xx_0
\in \Gamma_i$ and an arbitrary function $g(\xx)$, the notation
\begin{align}
  \jump{g}(\xx_0) = \lim_{\substack{\xx \to \xx_0 \\ \xx \in U_i^c}}g(\xx)  - 
                    \lim_{\substack{\xx \to \xx_0 \\ \xx \in U_i}}g(\xx),
\end{align}
denotes the jump of the limits of $g(\xx)$ taken from the outside to
the inside of $\Gamma_i$.
%\begin{align}
%\lim_{\xx \to \xx_0^+}g(\xx),\quad 
%\lim_{\xx \to \xx_0^-}g(\xx), \quad
%  \jump{g}(\xx_0) = \lim_{\xx \to \xx_0^+}g(\xx)  - \lim_{\xx \to \xx_0^-}g(\xx)
%\end{align}
%denotes the limit taken from points in $U_i^c$,  the limit taken from
%points in $U_i$, and the jump, respectively.  
\begin{lemma}
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:prejump}
  \FF_i = \int_{\Gamma_i} \jump{{\bf T}_2  \nnu}  \, \dif s,\quad
  T_i = \int_{\Gamma_i} (\xx - \aa_i)^{\perp} \cdot \jump{{\bf T}_2 \nnu} \, \dif s.
\end{align}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
To show~\eqref{eq:prejump}, we expand
\begin{align}
  \FF_i = \int_{\Gamma_i} {\bf T}_1\nnu + 
    {\bf T}_2\nnu + {\bf T}_3\nnu\,\dif s.
\end{align}
By~\eqref{eq:uidef} and~\eqref{eq:decompdivfree}, we have that $u_i$ is
smooth and $\nabla \cdot {\bf T}_1 = \mathbf{0}$ in $\mathbb{R}^n
\setminus U_i$. Similarly, $v_i = u - u_i$ is smooth and $\nabla \cdot
{\bf T}_3 = \mathbf{0}$ in $U_i$. By the divergence theorem,  
\begin{align}
  \int_{\Gamma_i}  {\bf T}_1\nnu \,\dif s
  = -\int_{\mathbb{R}^n \setminus U_i} \nabla \cdot {\bf T}_1 \,\dif \xx = \mathbf{0},\quad
    \int_{\Gamma_i}  {\bf T}_3 \nnu\,\dif s
  = \int_{U_i} \nabla \cdot {\bf T}_3 \,\dif \xx = \mathbf{0}.
\end{align}
Finally, $u_i$ and $v_i$ are smooth and $\nabla \cdot {\bf T}_2= 0$ in $U_i$. This gives
\begin{align}
  \mathbf{0} = \int_{U_i} \nabla \cdot {\bf T}_2 \, \dif \xx = -\int_{\Gamma_i}  
    ({\bf T}_2 \nnu)^-\,\dif s,
\end{align}
where the superscript denotes the limit taken from in $U_i$.  
Combining the previous four equations gives the first equation in \eqref{eq:prejump}.
The argument for the second equation in \eqref{eq:prejump} is identical. 
\end{proof}

We have the following jump relations for \eqref{eq:uidef}: 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:DLjump}
\jump{u_i} = \sigma, \quad
\jump{v_i} = 0, \quad
\jump{\nabla u_i} = \frac{\dif \sigma}{\dif s}\ttau,\quad
\jump{\nabla v_i} = \mathbf{0},
\end{equation}
on $\Gamma_i$. We get 
\begin{align*}
  \jump{{\bf T}_2\nnu}   &= \jump{\mathbf{S}(u_i,v_i)\nnu  +\mathbf{S}(v_i,u_i)\nnu} \\
  &= \jump{( 2\gamma\rho^{-1} u_i v_i \mathbf{I} + 2\gamma\rho \nabla u_i \cdot \nabla v_i \mathbf{I} 
- 2\gamma\rho \nabla u_i  \nabla v_i^T - 2\gamma\rho \nabla v_i \nabla u_i^T)  \nnu}\\
&= 2\gamma\rho^{-1} \sigma v_i \nnu + 2\gamma\rho \frac{d\sigma }{ds}\frac{dv_i }{ds} \nnu
- 2\gamma\rho \ \frac{d\sigma }{ds} \frac{dv_i }{d\nu} \ttau = \JJ_i,
\end{align*}
Combing  this with \eqref{eq:prejump}  gives  \eqref{eq:recipforcetorque}
as required.

\subsection{Model Parameters}
In the present manuscript, the particles are disks with centre $\aa_i$, and director $\dd_i$.  
The boundary conditions \eqref{eq:SLbc} are $f_i(\xx) = \tfrac{1}{2}(1 + \cos \theta_i)$ where $\theta_i$ is the angle between 
$\xx - \aa_i$ and $\dd_i$.  The particle diameters are $l_0 = 2.5$ nm representing the characteristic thickness of monolayer. 
The other physical parameters are 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:parameters}
\rho = 4 l_0,\quad \rho_0 = l_0,\quad \gamma = \text{4 pN nm}^{-1},\quad \mu = \text{1 cP}.
\end{equation}
We nondimensionalize the problem through the change of variables 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:nondimensionalize}
t \mapsto t \text{ ns}, \quad
\xx \mapsto \xx \text{ nm}, \quad 
\xx \mapsto \xx \text{ nm}, \quad 
\uu \mapsto \uu \text{ nm ns}^{-1}, \quad 
  p \mapsto p \text{ pN nm}^2.
\end{equation}
Here $\text{1 cP} = \text{1 pN ns nm}^{-2}$ is for the viscosity of water at room temperature.  
For the rest of the manuscript, the time axes are for ns; the pressure $p$ and stress $\sigma$, $\mathbf{T}^{\mathrm{hydro}}$
are for pN nm$^{-2}$.

\subsection{Permeability}
Vesicle membranes have a large area modulus $K_A$ and changes in surface are give rise to a membrane tension
$\tilde \gamma = K_A(A/A_0 - 1)$ where $A$ is the membrane surface area and $A_0$ is the reference surface area in the non-tensed state. 
Since we are dealing with two-dimensional vesicles, we replace $A$ and $A_0$ with the membrane arc length $L$ and reference length $L_0$
respectively.  Thus, the tension in a stretched cylindrical vesicle membrane is 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:stretch}
\tilde \gamma = K_A\left(\frac{L}{L_0} - 1 \right).
\end{equation}
A stretched vesicles has a Laplace pressure 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:LaplacePressure}
\Delta p = \frac{\tilde \gamma}{R} 
\end{equation}
where $\Delta p$ is the difference in internal pressure to the pressure at infinity
and  $R$ is the radius of the circular vesicle.  The factor 
$R^{-1}$ is the total curvature since  the principle curvature in the direction of the cylinder is zero.

The particles in our setup do not abut but rather have small gaps due to repulsive forces.
The gaps allow for some fluid flux across the JP bilayer.  Aqueous flux is quantified by a permeability constant $P$ in the equation
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:perm}
\frac{dA}{dt} = -P  L \Delta p.
\end{equation}
Combining \eqref{eq:stretch}, \eqref{eq:LaplacePressure}, and \eqref{eq:perm}, we can solve the for length $L$ 
\begin{equation}
L_0(L-L(0)) + L_0^2 \ln\left|\frac{L-L_0}{L(0)-L_0}\right| = -4\pi^2 P K_A t
\end{equation}
and compare with our data.

%\subsection{Jeffery Orbit}
%We use Jeffery orbits to numerically validate our solver for the mobility-problem.  
%The background flow is a shear flow $\uu_{\infty}(\xx) = \dot\gamma  \xx \cdot \mathbf{e}_2 \mathbf{e}_1$ with shear rate $\dot\gamma$
%and orthogonal unit vectors $\mathbf{e}_1$ and $\mathbf{e}_2$. 
%A single elliptical particle is suspended in the fluid with center at the origin.
%The Jeffrey orbit  
%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:jeff}
%\Theta(t) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{a}{b}\tan \left(\frac{ab \dot\gamma t}{a^2+b^2}\right)\right)
%\end{equation}
%gives the angle between the major axis and $\mathbf{e}_2$
%where $a$, $b$ are the semi-major and semi-minor axes. 
%We are assuming $\Theta(0) = 0$.
%Figure~\ref{figure1} shows that the angles coming from the integral equation method \eqref{eq:SKIE}-\eqref{eq:mobility2}
%are in complete agreement with the theoretical time course \eqref{eq:jeff}.  Hydrophobic attraction and repulsion are zero for a single particle.

\subsection{Self-Assembly and Relaxation}

In order to examine the dynamics of the Janus-vesicle using the HAP coupling with hydrodynamics interactions, for the target bilayer, a circular initial shape is chosen to perform the relaxation run. 
This structure consists of $N=58$ disks with particle radius $r=0.5$ and the starting diameter of 
the vesicle is about $8$ length units.
The starting center of mass position of the Janus-vesicle is pinned at the origin and particle velocities are tracked to determine the initial configuration for later use such as single and multiple vesicle simulations. 
The advantage of acquiring this configuration is to prevent some numerical instability issues when the minimum of the total energy is not achieved. 
For instance, the dynamics of the bilayer under a shear flow may reach different outcomes or equilibrium states.
Figure~\ref{figure2}(a) shows two sets of results: (1) the magnitudes of mean velocity components 
${\bf v}=\{v_x,v_y\}$ decrease exponentially with an approximation decaying rate $\sim0.005$; (2) the variation of the mean particle orientation $\theta$ also decreases over a period of time as expected from the self-assembly property of the model. This implies that a local energy minimum and the equilibrium configuration are nearly attained. 
The time step size $\Delta t=0.2$ is used for all simulations in this work including the relaxation run.
Figure~\ref{figure2}(b) shows the configuration difference between starting and ending frames in the relaxation run. The Figure~\ref{figure2}(c)-(d) demonstrate the fluid pressure profile of two configurations at $t=0$ and $t=1000$. The starting fluid pressure inside the permeable Janus-vesicle decreases as expected.

\section{\label{results}Numerical Results}

%\todo[inline]{Introduce dimensionless shear rate here (and check the numbers)}

Following the relaxation experiments of the Janus-vesicle, this section will focus on the behavior of 
Janus-vesicles under a number of flows. To extract physical quantities of the target structure using the
proposed model, the scaling laws and the dimensionless units are given as follows.
The length unit is scaled by the length of phospholipids $l=2.5$ nm which is set as the diameter of each 
Janus particle. The force is scaled from the interfacial tension $\gamma=4.11$ pN nm$^{-1}$ 
from ~\cite{Ryham16}. This also means that the energy unit is scaled by $1\ k_BT$. We then be able to
calculate the characteristic time scale $\tau = \mu l/\gamma = 0.61$ ns where the fluid viscosity $\mu=1$ cP.
With the same framework, \cite{Fu20} provides the bending rigidity $\kappa=8.51$ $k_BT$.
%
For the model parameters, the decay length of attraction $\rho = 2l = 5$ nm, the repulsion length scale is 
$\rho_0=0.5$, and the repulsion strength $M=4.0\ k_BT$.
The dimensionless shear rate is given by $\chi = \dot\gamma \tau$ where $\dot\gamma$ is the shear rate.


%For the $N$-body Janus-vesicle, we denote a constant initial radius $R_0=\sqrt{A_0/4\pi}$ with initial area $A_0$

%referred from~\cite{Finken08} and~\cite{Shaqfeh11},
%\begin{align}
%  \chi = \dot\gamma \frac{\mu R_0^3}{\kappa},

%where $\dot\gamma$ the dimensional shear rate, and $\mu$ the fluid viscosity.

\subsection{Tank-Treading Vesicles}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Vesicle in a Shear Flow}
\label{sec:ves_in_shear}
To study the deformation of a Janus-vesicle under a shear flow using the proposed algorithm, 
we adopt a widely tested numerical simulation in both continuum and molecular dynamics models, single vesicle under a shear flow. 
The background flow is a shear flow 
\begin{equation}
\uu_{\infty}(\xx) = \dot\gamma  \xx \cdot \mathbf{e}_2 \mathbf{e}_1
\end{equation}
with shear rate $\dot\gamma$
and orthogonal unit vectors $\mathbf{e}_x$ and $\mathbf{e}_y$ for the horizontal and vertical directions respectively. 
The well known results indicate that the vesicle has tank-treading behavior when 
there is no viscosity contrast in both fluids inside and outside of the vesicle. Within the framework of the simulation setup, the proposed model provides a feature that the fluid viscosity is constant over the computational domain and it is capable of performing these simulations.

The centroid of the pre-relaxed $58$-body Janus vesicle is initially placed at the origin then the shear flow 
with a certain shear rate $\chi$ is then turned on. 
The snapshots of the simulation for single vesicle in a shear flow with a shear rate $\chi=0.0025$ are shown 
in Figure~\ref{figure3}.
Panels (a)-(b) show the initial shape obtained from the relaxation run and the deformed 
configuration of the Janus-vesicle after a period of time ($t=4000$) is in panels (c)-(d). 
The background color in panels (a) and (c) presented in the figure is the strength of the action due to the
hydrophobic attraction. From weak to strong action field, the color varies from blue to red. Clearly, the
hydrophobic layer has the largest action. To demonstrate the tank-treading behavior of the vesicle, panels (b) 
and (d) provide the streamlines of the fluid velocity over the whole computational domain when the shear 
flow passes through the structure. The tank-treading motion of the structure is then observed, for instance,
the particle velocities in panel (d) indicate a clockwise tank-treading movement.

%

In order to extract more physical properties of the proposed model, we track the total length of the bilayer structure, the reduced area over the time, and the excess length. Here the enclosed area and the total length of the structure are calculated from the midplane.
These results are shown in Figure~\ref{figure4} where we compare results from the use of a set of shear 
rates $\chi=\{0.002,0.0025,0.003,0.0035\}$. 
The reduced area is given by $A^* = 4\pi A/L^2$ where $A$ the area, and $L$ the total length of the Janus-vesicle with respect to the midplane. 
Furthermore, the excess length is given by $\Delta=L/\sqrt{A^*/\pi}-2\pi$.
Since the starting configuration is close to a circular shape, the reduced area decreases from a value very close to $1$. For the test cases in Figure~\ref{figure4}, the smooth curves in panel (a) are fitted using an
exponential model given by $A^* = a_0 + b_0 \exp(-kt)$. Panel (b) shows that the decay rate $k$ is independent of the shear rate when the shear is above a threshold and the terminal reduced areas for each 
case of the shear rates are given in the inset. It is also clear that a slower shear rate generates a higher terminal reduced area and has a faster convergence then the high shear rate cases. 
With a converging total arc length as shown in panel (c), a slower shear rate also produces a smaller excess length shown in panel (d).
In summary, the small oscillations in all results are due to the granularity of the Janus-vesicle which tend to having slightly non-smooth curves in simulations. Overall the total lengths of the bilayer have the same converging value in all test shear rates. Moreover, based on the numerical experiments, we observe that the reduce area converges relatively early when the shear rate is lower than $\chi=0.003$.

For all panels, a set of shear rates $\chi=\{0.002,0.0025,0.003,0.0035\}$ is used in simulations. 
The legend in panel (d) applies to both panels (a) and (c).

    \label{figure4}
\end{figure}




\subsubsection{Intermonolayer friction}
An interesting phenomenon also rises up in the proposed setup where the inter-monolayer slip occurs 
between two leaflets. When a shear rate is large enough, take $\chi = 0.005$ as an example, 
Figure~\ref{figure5} shows the schematic of the test where a particle pair is initially marked and we then track the positions of this particle pair over a period of time. 
In this series of tests, we monitor the mean particle position change and mean angle $\theta(t)$ between particle relative positions with respect to the vesicle center over the time. It is clear to see that the outer leaflet always has larger tangential velocity than the one from the inner leaflet and the mean angle $\theta(t)$ increases. This inter-leaflet sliding phenomenon is consistent with what has been seen
in articles in molecular dynamics simulations.

The configuration plots have two fixed particles marked in yellow and blue and labeled with the corresponding time $t=2000$ and $t=9000$. The midplane curve is denoted as $\Sigma_M$. We provide numerical results of $\theta(t)$ for cases of shear rates $\chi$.
  }
    \label{figure5}
\end{figure}



To calculate the inter-monolayer friction coefficient for the apposing JP leaflets, we let  
\begin{equation}
b = \frac{\langle F\rangle}{\langle L \rangle \langle U\rangle },
\end{equation}
%
where $\langle F\rangle = \langle \int_{\mathcal{C}_M} \jump{\ttau \cdot \sigma \cdot \nnu} \,ds\rangle$ 
is the time-averaged, tangential force along the midplane curve $\mathcal{C}_m$. 
The parameters $\langle L\rangle$ and $\langle U\rangle$ are the time-averaged midplane curve length and
intermonolayer slip velocity respectively.  

We calculate $\langle F\rangle$ by first evaluating the smooth tangential force along curves a positive distance inside and 
outside $\mathcal{C}_m$ respectively, and then interpolating at zero distance to give a force jump. 
We have made a slight abuse of language: due to the problem being two-dimensional,
the integral $\langle F\rangle$ is actually a force density per length which when divided by length gives the requisite force per area. 
%which when divided by length 

Table~\ref{table1} provides dimensional friction coefficients $b$ for several shear rates
and the results are in quantitative agreement with 
values previously reported in the literature~\cite{sch-vla-mik2010} and~\cite{denOtter2007}.  
The coefficients generally lie within the range 0.2 to 0.3 pN$\cdot$ns nm$^{-3}$ but there are some 
outliers.  These outliers ($\dot\gamma = 0.0041$ ns$^{-1}$ and 
$\dot\gamma = 0.0066$ ns$^{-1}$) correspond to slip velocities that are too low relative to shear rate (see the green and red curve in Figure \ref{figure5}: panel (c)).
The JP vesicle consists of only  58 particles and so it is not surprising that discrete effects produce outliers. 

\todo[inline]{If $B$ is the numerically calculated friction coefficient,  then 
$b = B/2.5^3$ pN ns nm$^{-3}$ gives the dimensional value.

If $P$ is the numerically calculated pressure, then $p = P/2.5$ pN nm$^{-2}$ is the dimensional pressure.}

\subsubsection{Vesicle in a Parabolic Flow}

Besides the tests of a Janus-vesicle in a shear flow, an interesting test can also use the proposed model and the setup. Consider a symmetric parabolic flow about the $x$-axis, \cite{Kaoui09} studied shapes of the red blood cell immersed in a parabolic flow using a continuum model. With a similar setup, the background flow for this set of simulations is given by
\begin{equation}
\uu_\infty = v_{max}\left[ 1 - \left( \frac{y}{wR_0}\right)^2 \right]{\bf e}_x,
\end{equation}
%
where $v_{max}$ is the flow strength and $w$ controls the shape of the flow. $R_0$ is defined as the radius of the Janus-vesicle at $t=0$. 

Figure~\ref{figure6} gives three configurations for one specific case where the centroid of the Janus-vesicle is initially placed slightly above the $x$-axis. The parameters are $v_{max} = 8.0$, $w=10$, and $R_0=8$. The red curves are the midplanes and a particle pair is marked in color. We observe that the deformed 
Janus-vesicle has a counterclockwise movement and the shape of the vesicle approaches to an asymmetric
slipper shape. For this test run, the reduced area for this configuration is $\sim0.9$ which matches the previous numerical tests in \cite{Kaoui09} where a slipper-like shape occurs when the flow velocity is weak and the reduced area is large. 
A schematic of the setup is shown in Figure~\ref{figure7} where the blue horizontal line represents the mean
$y$-position of all particles. The inset of Figure~\ref{figure7} shows the trajectory of the mean position in 
$y$-direction which decreases toward $y=1$ for a period of time and starts to have an oscillatory motion.

With the choice of a large shear rate, a pore formation or a complete membrane rupture can be captured during simulations. Figure~\ref{figure8} shows a demonstration of a vesicle under a shear flow with shear rate $\chi=0.1$. An interesting phenomenon occurs in panels (c) and (d) where two separated bilayers move along the background shear flow symmetrically. Consequently, a periodic motion for bilayers may occur 
with the choices of shear rates. One can expect that these two layers will flow far apart from each other for much higher shear rates.

\subsubsection{Shear Flow}


Figure~\ref{figure9} demonstrates the simulation results of two Janus-vesicles in a shear flow where the testing shear rate is $\chi=0.005$ and the flow is given by $\dot x = \chi y$. 
In panel (a), the starting frame, two center-of-mass positions are placed 
on the same horizontal level, at $(-10,0)$ and $(10,0)$. Since we already have a pre-relaxed $58$-body in previous sections, we duplicate the state to have the initial configuration (shown in panel (a)) in this section. 
In all panels, the blue and red curves represent the moving paths of two Janus-vesicle centroids and they move nearly a round when $t=4000$ as shown in panel (h). 
We observe that the rotation continues as time goes and an interesting event occurs in the simulation that an adhesive effect can be seen and tuned. In other words, the adhesive behavior will be absent when two vesicles are centered at a different level and are well separated in $y$-direction. 

The fluid pressure profiles of snapshots are given in Figure~\ref{figure10}.
As expected, there is no pressure jump between the internal and external fluids from the beginning of the
simulation and this is shown in the background pressure plot. 
Panels (b)-(d) show the configurations when $t = \{500,1000,1500\}$ and 
the streamlines are plotted in the background for all panels. We include the numerical results using 
a continuum model in all insets and these comparisons give a qualitative agreement between two models.

\subsubsection{Extensional Flow}


With a similar setup in the case of two Janus-vesicles in a shear flow, we use the same two pre-relaxed $58$-body Janus-vesicles to perform the simulations when the flow type is an extensional flow with flow rate $\chi=0.005$. This extensional flow is stretching along the $y$ direction and squeezing in $x$ direction.
Figure~\ref{figure11} provides simulation results when the center-of-mass positions are placed differently.
One can notice that when two centroids are placed on the same horizontal level, two Janus-vesicles reach
an equilibrium state without separation as shown in case (i). If only one centroid is placed above the $x$-axis, for instance, case (ii), two Janus-vesicle move together toward the upward. This is the consequence when the adhesive effect beats the flow strength. In case (iii), two centroids have a small bias in $y$-direction and they
start to move apart along $\pm y$-direction. Finally, case (iv) has a larger initial separation in $y$-direction and two Janus-vesicle moves much faster toward $\pm y$-directions.

Figure~\ref{figure12} shows numerical results when the centroids of two bodies are placed at
$(-10,-0.1)$ and $(10,0.1)$, that is, case (iii) of Figure~\ref{figure11}. With this setup, 
we can make sure that two Janus-vesicles will separate along $y$-direction eventually and we compare the results against a continuum model as shown in all insets. 
Panels (b)-(d) show the transitions of two vesicles moving under an extensional flow.  Since two bilayers are close enough from the beginning of the run, two vesicles are first pushed toward each other then separate along the streamlines. In fluid pressure profiles, the pressure is initially high between the gap formed by two 
Janus-vesicles and decreases during the separation. The short range repulsion plays an important role to avoid structure collisions and this result can be compared with some findings in continuum modeling simulations.

\section{\label{conclusion}Conclusion}




This study proposes a continuum coarse-grained model for Janus-vesicle that focuses on the 
hydrophobic interactions between lipids and hydrodynamic interactions.
The mobility problem using integral equation methods combines the previously introduced HAP and the 
revised hydrophobic force for obtaining particle dynamics. 
The imposed forces and torques of Janus particles adopt not only HAP but a newly developed short 
range repulsion given by \ref{eq:REPULforce} and \ref{eq:REPULtorque}.
The hydrodynamic stress tensor calculated in the algorithm leads to examinations of permeable 
membrane where the stretching modulus $K_A$ and the permeability constant $P$ can be obtained.


With the use of selected parameters, the numerical algorithm yields good qualitative results such as
phenomena in tank-treading Janus-vesicle and asymmetric slipper shape in a parabolic flow. 
We also demonstrate the membrane rupture in a flow at high shear rate and this makes a breakthrough 
about having an idea for simulating such phenomenon different from other continuum modeling simulations.
Inter-monolayer friction coefficients are then obtained and reported by calculating the pressure jumps and
slip velocities with respect to the bilayer midplane.
Results of two Janus-vesicles in flow simulations produce an outstanding agreement with ones generated 
using continuum modeling.

Our future goal is to extend the current framework to a three-dimensional Janus-vesicle system. 
The further implementation of adding a fast algorithms such as the fast multipole method is also a 
practical approach.
