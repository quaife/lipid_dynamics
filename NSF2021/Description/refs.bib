Journal = {Scientific Reports},

Abstract = {Liquid-ordered lipid domains represent a lateral inhomogeneity in cellular membranes. These domains have elastic and physicochemical properties different from those of the surrounding membrane. In particular, their thickness exceeds that of the disordered membrane. Thus, elastic deformations arise at the domain boundary in order to compensate for the thickness mismatch. In equilibrium, the deformations lead to an incomplete register of monolayer ordered domains: the elastic energy is minimal if domains in opposing monolayers lie on the top of each other, and their boundaries are laterally shifted by about 3 nm. This configuration introduces a region, composed of one ordered and one disordered monolayers, with an intermediate bilayer thickness. Besides, a jump in a local monolayer curvature takes place in this intermediate region, concentrating here most of the elastic stress. This region can participate in a lateral sorting of membrane inclusions by offering them an optimal bilayer thickness and local curvature conditions. In the present study, we consider the sorting of deformable lipid inclusions, undeformable peripheral and deeply incorporated peptide inclusions, and undeformable transmembrane inclusions of different molecular geometry. With rare exceptions, all types of inclusions have an affinity to the ordered domain boundary as compared to the bulk phases. The optimal lateral distribution of inclusions allows relaxing the elastic stress at the boundary of domains.},
