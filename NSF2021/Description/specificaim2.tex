\subsection{Specific Aim 2: Efficient, high-order methods for
large-scale simulations}
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Over the past decade, there has been an explosion of interest in
small-scale processes that utilize capillary forces and van der Waals
interactions to coordinate movement and bind microscopic components in
solvent~\cite{Pandey2011, Zhang2017, Siontorou2017}. Additionally,
hydrodynamic interactions are central to fabricate complex,
three-dimensional microstructures~\cite{Dasgupta2017, Leong2007,
Reynolds2019, Cho2010}. Hydrodynamic effects cannot be ignored since
they, like for the rates of biological functions like pore
dynamics~\cite{RYHAM20112929}, set the rate of dissipation. In Specific
Aim 2, we propose novel and efficient high-order numerical methods to
simulate dynamic assembly of particles under HAP potential in a viscous
solvent. As described in~\eqref{eq:stokes} and illustrated in
Figure~\ref{fig:flow_map}, the solvent phase is modeled by the Stokes
equations for an incompressible, viscous fluid, and these equations are
coupled to the screened-Laplace equation~\eqref{eq:SL} through viscous
and hydrophobic stress balance.

The HAP model requires solving exterior problems for the order
parameter~\eqref{eq:SL} and the Stokes equations~\eqref{eq:stokes}. We
will develop methods based on combinations of volume and layer
potentials. Numerical methods to solve these integral equations (IEs)
have several advantages over their PDE-based counterpart: by
construction, they satisfy far-field and mass conservation conditions;
only $\partial\Omega$ needs to be discretized for layer potentials;
carefully chosen IEs result in a well-conditioned linear system that is
solved with a mesh-independent number of GMRES iterations; and
high-order or spectral accuracy is attainable with appropriate
quadrature methods. The PIs have demonstrated that IEs are a powerful
tool to simulate two-dimensional suspensions of amphiphilic
particles~\cite{Fu2018_SIAM, FuQuRyYo20}. Moreover, elements of these
formulations have been described in three dimensions~\cite{ying_2006,
manasthesis, rac-gre2016}. This proposal will extend the two-dimensional
methods to more general amphiphilic particle models that
satisfy~\eqref{eq:SL}, and all the methods can naturally be extended to
three dimensions. \S\ref{subsec:AC} describes how the non-linear
Allen-Cahn equation~\eqref{eq:SL} will be iteratively solved using IE
formulations. Then, \S\ref{subsec:NumericalIssues} describes how we will
combine preconditioning strategies with fast summation methods to
accelerate the time to solution, and \S\ref{subsec:timeStepping}
describes adaptive time stepping methods,

\subsubsection{Iterative methods for the Allen-Cahn HAP model}
\label{subsec:AC}

The PIs have developed numerical methods to solve~\eqref{eq:SL} when
$f(u) = u^2$---this choice results in the linear screened Laplace
equation. For a more general $f$, such as a double well potential, we
will interpret the solution of~\eqref{eq:SL} as the root finding problem
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:F}
  J[u] = -\rho^2 \Delta u + f'(u).
\end{align}
This non-linear PDE will be solved with Newton's method
\begin{align*}
  u^{N+1} = u^{N} - \alpha (dJ^N)^{-1} J(u^N),
\end{align*}
where $dJ^N = -\rho^2 \Delta + f''(u^N)$ is the Fr\'{e}chet derivative
of $F$, and $\alpha$ is the step size which will be determined using
backtracking. As expected, the biggest computational challenge is
solving $- \rho^2 \Delta v + f''(u^{N}) v = J[u^N]$. Solving this
variable coefficient PDE with an integral equation is challenging since
a fundamental solution is not readily available. We propose to instead
use an inexact Newton's method where $dJ^{-1}$ is defined in terms of
the piecewise quadratic approximation
\begin{align*}
  f(u) \approx \tilde{f}(u) = bu + \begin{cases}
    a(u - u_0)^2, &\mbox{if } u \leq (u_0 + u_1)/2, \\
    (u - u_1)^2, &\mbox{if } u > (u_0 + u_1)/2.
  \end{cases}
\end{align*}
and the resulting inexact Newton's method requires solving the piecewise
constant PDE
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:screenedPoisson}
  -\rho^2 \Delta v + \tilde{f}''(u^{N})v = J[u^N],
\end{align}
which is a screened Poisson equation with piecewise a constant screening
coefficient. We test the efficacy of exact and inexact Newton's method
applied to~\eqref{eq:F} in $(0,1)$ by discretizing $dJ$ with a
second-order finite difference method. The choice of parameters $a$,
$b$, $U_0$, and $U_1$ result in the double well potential illustrated in
Figure~\ref{fig:CA}(a), and both the exact and inexact Newton's methods
converge to the solution in Figure~\ref{fig:CA}(b).
Figure~\ref{fig:CA}(c) shows the max norm of the residual at each Newton
iterate when using the exact second derivative (red curve) and the
piecewise constant approximate (blue curve). While the inexact Newton's
method requires roughly twice as many iterations to reach of a tolerance
of $10^{-4}$, each iteration is significantly cheaper in higher
dimensions.

  0.5$, $u_1 = 2$, $a = 1$, $b = 0.4$. (b) The solution of the
  Allen-Cahn equation~\eqref{eq:SL}. (c) The convergence of the exact
  and inexact Newton's methods.}
\end{wrapfigure}
Having demonstrated that the inexact Newton method converges in one
dimension, it will be coupled with IE formulations to to
solve~\eqref{eq:SL} in two and three dimensions. We first partition
$\Omega$ into $\Omega_0 = \{\xx \in \Omega \:|\: u(\xx) < (u_0 +
u_1)/2\}$ and $\Omega_1 = \{\xx \in \Omega \:|\: u(\xx) > (u_0 +
u_1)/2\}$, and we let $\Lambda = \{\xx \in \Omega \:|\: u(\xx) = (u_0 +
u_1)/2 \}$ be their common boundary, and we let $G_0$ be the fundamental
solution of $(-\rho^2 \Delta - 2a)$ and $G_1$ be the fundamental
solution of $(-\rho^2 \Delta + 2)$. Then, the solution
of~\eqref{eq:screenedPoisson} can be written as $u = u^P + u^H$ where
$u^P$ is a volume potential and $u^H$ is a layer potential. The volume
potential is
\begin{align*}
  u^{P}(\xx) = \int_{\Omega_i} G_i(\xx,\yy) J[u^N](\yy)\, d\yy, 
    \quad i = 1,2,
\end{align*}
but it is discontinuous across $\Lambda$ and does not satisfy the
prescribed hydrophobic boundary conditions on the particles $\Gamma_i$.
Assuming the particles are entirely contained in the hydrophobic region,
the boundary conditions will be enforced with the layer potentials
\begin{align*}
  u^{H}(\xx) = \begin{cases}
    \displaystyle\int_{\Lambda} G_0(\xx,\yy) \eta_0(\yy) \, ds_\yy + 
    \displaystyle\int_{\Gamma} \pderiv{}{\nn_\yy} G_0(\xx,\yy)
      \sigma(\yy) \,ds_\yy, \quad & \xx \in \Omega_0, \\
    \displaystyle\int_{\Lambda} G_1(\xx,\yy) \eta_1(\yy) \, ds_\yy,
     & \xx \in \Omega_1.
  \end{cases}
\end{align*}
The density functions $\sigma$, $\eta_0$, and $\eta_1$ are determined so
that $u = u^P + u^H$ satisfies the hydrophobic boundary condition on
$\Gamma = \cup_i \Gamma_i$, and that it is continuous and differentiable
across $\Lambda$. This approach for using IEs to solve elliptic PDEs
with with piecewise constant coefficients has succesfully been used in
other application such as scattering~\cite{hyu-bar2014,
che-cho-cai2018}.

\subsubsection{Accelerating the iterative solvers}
\label{subsec:NumericalIssues}

When solving for the density functions $\eta_0$, $\eta_1$, and $\sigma$,
a carefully chosen IE formulation requires a mesh-independent number of
GMRES iterations~\cite{cam-ips-kel-mey-xue1996}. Therefore, the required
CPU time is proportional to the cost of a matrix-vector multiplication
that can be performed in optimal or near-optimal time with the fast
multipole method (FMM)~\cite{fmm5} and its extensions~\cite{fmm1, fmm2,
fmm3, fmm4, fmm6, fmm7, fmm8}. PI BQ is experienced with applying FMMs
for the Stokes equation~\cite{qua-bir2014, bys-sha-qua2020} and the
screened Laplace equation~\cite{kro-qua2011, qua2011}. Furthermore, to
reduce the number of GMRES iterations, preconditioning strategies such
as the inverse Fast Multipole Method (IFMM)~\cite{cou-pou-dar2017} and
domain decomposition~\cite{che-bir2021}. PI BQ used the IFMM to
precondition Stokes equations~\cite{qua-cou-dar2018}. A suite of other
preconditioners including sparse approximate inverses~\cite{che2000} and
multigrid~\cite{hem-sch1981, sch1982} will be investigated.


% ----------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Eliminating contact with adaptive time stepping}
\label{subsec:timeStepping}

A numerical issue when simulating the self-assembly of amphiphilic
particles is avoiding particle collision. The hydrophobic attraction
potential drives the amphiphilic particles towards one another and this
leads to physical contact in finite time. Such particle collisions in a
dense, rigid-body suspension are a great challenge and can be a
bottleneck in large-scale simulations. We propose to remedy this
computational challenge by developing novel high-order adaptive time
stepping methods. PI BQ developed a high-order adaptive time stepping
method for hydrodynamic suspensions \cite{qua-bir2016}, and it has
served as a robust method to simulate processes including mixing and
adhesion in suspensions~\cite{qua-vee-you2019, kab-qua-bir2017}.
Following this previous work, the proposed work will use a spectral
deferred correction method~\cite{dut-gre-rok2000} since it iteratively
applies a low-order, single-step method to achieve high-order accuracy.
To estimate the error, at each time step, we will compute the total
force and torque of the system which is computationally cheap and
physically zero. PI BQ's experience is that error estimates based on
physical constraints such as force- and torque-free conditions
appropriately determine how the time step should be adjusted so that the
dynamics are resolved without the computational expense of techniques
such as embedded Runge-Kutta methods, step-doubling, and Richardson
extrapolation.

%Our previous work avoided particle contact through Lennard-Jones body
%forces~\cite{Fu2018_SIAM}. Such steep, short-range, steric interactions 
%introduce numerical stiffness and limit the time step size. To
%remove this stiffness, we propose a geometry-based contact
%method~\cite{har-pon-sor-zor2011}. This method has been applied to
%vesicle suspensions~\cite{lu-rah-zor2017} and to rigid body suspensions in
%two dimensions~\cite{bys-sha-qua2020} and three
%dimensions~\cite{Yan2019}. These methods determine repulsion force by
%solving a non-linear complementarity problem with a geometric constraint
%that the configuration is non-overlapping. In this manner, contact is
%avoided without the excessively small time steps required by stiff
%Lennard-Jones forces.
%
%%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%\subsubsection{Novel reciprocal identities}
%\label{subsec:reciprocal}
%The force and torque formulas~\eqref{forceandtorque} use the
%hydrophobic stress along the particle boundaries. Unfortunately,
%layer potentials for $\nabla u$ involve hyper-singular integrals and
%this introduces large amounts of quadrature error on the particle
%boundaries (Figure~\ref{fig:bierror}). Therefore, it is useful to devise
%reciprocal identities for the force and torque on body $i$ that do not
%require integration along body $i$. One identity, that we have proved,
%is
%\begin{align}
%    \label{eq:reciprocal}
%{\bf F}_{\text{hydro},i} = \sum_{j \neq i} \int_{\partial P_i}[\boldsymbol{\sigma}_{ij} + \boldsymbol{\sigma}_{ji}]\boldsymbol{\nu}\,\dif S,\quad
%{\bf G}_{\text{hydro},i} = \sum_{j \neq i} \int_{\partial P_i} ({\bf
%  x}-\mathbf{a}_i) \times [\boldsymbol{\sigma}_{ij} +
%  \boldsymbol{\sigma}_{ji}]\boldsymbol{\nu}\,\dif S, 
%\end{align}
%for $i=1,\ldots,N$. Here, $u_i$ is the solution of the screened Laplace
%equation when only the contribution from particle $i$ is considered and
%$\boldsymbol{\sigma}_{ij} = \rho^{-1} u_iu_j \mathbf{I} +
%\rho\left((\nabla u_i \cdot \nabla u_j) \mathbf{I} - 2 \nabla u_i
%\otimes \nabla u_j\right)$. Equation~\eqref{eq:reciprocal} does not
%require knowledge of $\nabla u$ on particle boundary $i$, and this is
%enormously beneficial for calculating the hydrophobic force and torque.
%

%\subsubsection{Fluctuating hydrodynamics}
%\label{subsec:fluctuating}
%Once algorithms that address quadrature, adaptive time stepping, and
%contact are implemented, we will embark on incorporating fluctuating
%hydrodynamics that are especially important at scales of amphiphilic
%particles. Bao et al.~\cite{Bao17,Bao18} developed two-dimensional BIE
%formulations for Brownian rigid bodies. To satisfy the covariance of the
%rigid body velocities, they use an ill-conditioned, first-kind integral
%equation method. The proposed work will consider a layer potential
%formulation that has much better conditioning properties. This strategy
%was attempted in~\cite{Bao18}, but they claim that a necessary
%regularization of the covariance matrix leads to a drastic loss of
%accuracy in numerical fluctuation-dissipation balance. However, only one
%regularization strategy was considered, and as PI BQ has shown in
%previous work, the regularization choice significantly affects the
%resulting physics~\cite{ong-chr-qua2017}. Therefore, different
%regularization strategies will be investigated with the goal of finding
%well-conditioned BIE formulations that control the accuracy of the
%fluctuation-dissipation balance.
