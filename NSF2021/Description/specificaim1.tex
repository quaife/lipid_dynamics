\subsection{Specific Aim 1: Measuring material properties of amphiphile
  self-assembly}
\label{subsec:specific_aim_1}
Specific Aim 1 proposes a novel mathematical model for particle
self-organization driven by long-range interfacial forces. 
The research aims to provide fundamental insight into the
self-assembly dynamics of amphiphilic particles. These results will
facilitate optimal design of smart materials by tuning the geometry and
properties of the amphiphilic particles.
Applications in this area include cargo-carrying capacity, 
catalytic activity, or stimuli-responsive shape-changes
\cite{McBr21, HaBr20}.

   In the HAP formulation, hydronamic interactions
   come from the Stokes equations and
   hydrophobic interactions come from the structure order parameter $u$.
   The colormap is for the intensity of $u$.}
\end{wrapfigure}

The mathematical formulation is a nonlinear system for the dynamics of a
collection of particles. The interactions come from a system of 
partial differential equations (PDEs) that comprise hydrodynamic
interactions and hydrophobic interactions.
%The formulation prevents particle collisions through excluded volume
%potentials. 
The hydrodynamic interactions come from the mobility problem for rigid
particles immersed in a viscous solvent. We then use a
second-order Adams-Bashforth method to update the particle configuration.
Assuming inertial terms are
negligible, the particle motion is goverened by the Stokes equations
\begin{subequations}
  \label{eq:stokes}
  \begin{alignat}{3}
  \label{eq:stokes1}
  -\mu \Delta \uu + \nabla p &= \mathbf{0}, && \xx \in \Omega, \\
    \label{eq:stokes2}
  \nabla\cdot \uu &= 0, \qquad && \xx \in \Omega, \\
\label{eq:stokes3}
  \uu - \uu_\infty &\to \mathbf{0}, && |\xx| \to \infty,
  \end{alignat}
\end{subequations}
%\begin{alignat}{3}
%\label{eq:stokes1}
%  -\mu \Delta \uu + \nabla p &= \mathbf{0}, 
%    && \xx \in \Omega, \\
%\label{eq:stokes2}
%  \nabla\cdot \uu &= 0, \qquad && \xx \in \Omega, \\
%\label{eq:stokes3}
%  \uu - \uu_\infty &\to \mathbf{0}, && |\xx| \to \infty,
%\end{alignat}
%
where $\uu$ is the velocity and $p$ is the pressure of the solvent,
$\uu_\infty$ is the background flow, and $\mu$ is the constant solvent
viscosity. The domain $\Omega = \Omega(t)$ is the fluid region surrounding the
particles and changes shape as the particles move.
Since the particles are rigid, the solvent velocity satisfies
a no-slip boundary condition for a rigid body motion 
%\begin{align}
%\label{eq:rigid_bc}
%  \uu(\xx) = \vv_i + \omega_i  (\xx - \aa_i)^\perp, \quad
%    \xx \in \Gamma_i,\qquad  i=1,\ldots,N_p,
%\end{align}
on the particle boundary $\Gamma_i$ with translational velocity $\vv_i$
and angular velocity $\omega_i$ (Figure \ref{fig:flow_map}).
Given imposed forces acting on each
particle, the \emph{mobility problem} consists of finding
translational and angular velocities so that viscous fluid forces
balance the imposed forces.

The hydrophobic interactions come from the tendency of particles to
minimize the free energy of the structure of the surrounding water
molecules. The free energy functional takes the form 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:free_energy}
  F[u] = C \int_{\Omega} \left(\rho |\nabla u|^2 + \rho^{-1} f(u)\right)
  \,d\xx,
\end{equation}
where $u$ is an order parameter for the structure of water, $\rho$ is a
decay length, $C$ is a constant, and $f(u)$ is a potential.
Hydrogen-bond persistence times are on the order of picoseconds
which is much smaller than characteristic time for 
particle motion \cite{MaGa13}.
Thus we assume $u$ minimizes $F[u]$ for all times.
Assuming appropriate conditions on $f(u)$ (\cite{evans10}, \S 8.2),
$u$ is bounded and satisfies the Euler-Lagrange equation
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:SL}
-\rho^2 \Delta u + \tfrac{1}{2}f'(u) = 0  \text{ in } \Omega,\quad u = g,
\text{ on } \bd\Omega.
\end{equation}
The boundary condition $g$ is a material label that is transported with
the particle (Figure~\ref{fig:bcs}).

The particles lower the free energy $F[u]$ of the surrounding water
by moving. We calculate the rate of change of $F[u]$ using
\emph{variation of the domain} ~\cite{Fu2018_SIAM,Bandle2015, Schiffer1954, Grinfeld2010}.
Carrying out
this variation yields a 
%The hydrophobic forces are torques are
%\begin{equation}
%  \label{eq:hydrophobicAttraction}
%  \FF_i^{\text{hydro}} = \int_{\Gamma_i} {\bf T}\cdot \nnu \, \dif s, 
%    \quad 
%    T_i^{\text{hydro}} = \int_{\Gamma_i} (\xx - \aa_i)^{\perp} \cdot
%    ({\bf T} \cdot \nnu) \dif s.
%\end{equation}
stress  
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:stress}
\mathbf{T}
= C \left[ \rho^{-1} f(u) \mathbf{I}
  + \rho \left(|\nabla u|^2 \mathbf{I} - 2\nabla u \nabla u^T\right)\right].
\end{align}
The imposed forces and torques come from the integration of $\mathbf{T}$
along the particle boundary.
These forces and torques couple the Stokes equations \eqref{eq:stokes},
to semilinear elliptic equation \eqref{eq:SL}.
Solving for the translational and rotational velocities gives the
particle evolution.

The stress~\eqref{eq:stress} was first
introduced by~\cite{Fu2018_SIAM} and is the higher-dimensional
generalization of disjoining pressure \cite{MaRa76, ErLjCl89, KoNa15,
Nagle17, KUZMIN2005}. It is the mathematical ingredient responsible for
forming particle aggregates that sequester their hydrophobic surface
regions.

%By solving the above system, we obtain translational and angular
%velocities of the many-body system. A second-order Adams-Bashforth
%scheme updates the particle positions and orientations.

The formulation presents a number of mathematical and numerical
challenges. For one, the domain is constantly changing so that a new
boundary value problem must be solved at each time step. The particle
boundaries are nearly touching and high-order numerical
schemes and adaptively chosen time-step sizes
are required to calculate trajectories accurately.
Furthermore, the domain is unbounded and care must be taken 
in capturing the far-field boundary conditions correctly. 
Finally, the numerical routine must handle large system sizes
efficiently.

%and
%\begin{equation}
%  \label{eq:force}
%  \int_{\Gamma_i} \ssigma \cdot \nnu \, \dif s = \FF_i,\quad 
%  \int_{\Gamma_i} (\xx - \aa_i)^{\perp} \cdot (\ssigma \cdot \nnu) \,
%  \dif s = T_i, \qquad i=1,\ldots,N_b,
%\end{equation}
%where
%$\ssigma = -p \mathbf{I} + \mu \left(\nabla \uu + \nabla \uu^T \right)$
%is the hydrodynamic stress tensor (pressure tensor) and $\nnu$ is the
%particle outward normal.

\subsubsection{Janus-particle self-assembly} 
Distinct morphologies can be obtained from 
the HAP model by shifting the boundary condition $g$.
Consider the linear case where $f(u) = u^2$.
This choice makes \eqref{eq:SL} a boundary value
problem for the screened-Laplace equation
and the solutions have a boundary layer structure that decays to $0$ in the
bulk with the decay length $\rho$.
We consider three kinds of boundary conditions
on particle $\Gamma_i$:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:bcs}
  \begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
     \text{(a)} & \text{(b)} & \text{(c)} \\
    \hline
    \rule{0pt}{4ex} 
      $g(\mathbf{x}) = \displaystyle \frac{1+\cos (\theta_i(\xx))}{\sqrt{3\pi r}}$
    & $g(\mathbf{x}) = \displaystyle \frac{2+\cos (\theta_i(\xx))}{\sqrt{9\pi r}}$
    & $g(\mathbf{x}) = \displaystyle \frac{\cos (\theta_i(\xx))}{\sqrt{\pi r}}$
\end{tabular}
\end{equation}
  The number $\theta_i(\xx)$ is the angle formed by the position $\xx$, the
particle center $\aa_i$, and the particle director $\dd_i$ (Figure \ref{fig:flow_map}).
The normalizations e.g., $(\pi r)^{-1/2}$, provide a uniform
surface energy $\int_{\Gamma_i} g^2 \,ds = 1$ for circular particles
of radius $r$. 
The cases (b) and (c) are obtained by applying a vertical shift
and scaling to case (a), see Figure \ref{fig:bcs}.
Using this setup, we simulate the dynamics of 100 particles with random
initial position and orientation.

    structure at the particle interface: an amphiphilic particle (left),

  particle with anisotropic intensity (middle), a water structure with
  positive/negative charge (right). The dashed curve is the boundary of the
  disk and the arrow is its director for each particle.}
\end{wrapfigure}
Case (a) models amphiphilic particles.
Amphiphilic particles have a hydrophobic tail and a hydrophilic head
and these are accounted for as follows.
The hydrophilic side takes the value $u =0$.
This mimicks the apolar head of a lipid, for example, which does
not alter the structure of adjacent waters. The hydrophobic side
represents hydrocarbons and takes the value 
$u > 0$. The interaction between particles is attractive,
and particles will collectively orient their tails toward
one another. 
PIs RR and YNY's previous work showed that this   
boundary condition produces two-dimensional micelles and
bilayers~\cite{Fu2018_SIAM}, as illustrated in 
Figure~\ref{fig:self-assembly}(a).

    relative orientation of nearby particles

  }
\end{wrapfigure}
Multilamelar bilayers arise when both sides of the particle
are hydrophobic (Figure~\ref{fig:self-assembly}(b)).
The boundary condition \eqref{eq:bcs}(b) 
gives a particle with a hydrophobic intensity that is greater
on the $\theta_i = 0$ side than on the $\theta_i = \pi$ side.
The initial self-assembly is similar to that in case (a).
The difference arises in the long-time dynamics where the bilayers
no longer remain well-separated. 
Rather, the bilayers form layers 
as a consequence of the interfacial tension of exposed particle
heads~\cite{Huetal19, deMeetal21}. 


Finally, boundary condition \eqref{eq:bcs}(c) models 
a particle whose head surface repels the tail surface as proposed in
\cite{MaRa76, Ma77}.
The particles initially form chains with their directors perpendicular to the
length of the chain. The equilibrium structure
resembles a checkerboard pattern
where each particle coordinates
its head with the head of three other particles and its tail with the
tail of three other particles Figure~\ref{fig:self-assembly}(c).

\end{figure}

The ultimate goal is to use numerical simulations to aid
the syntheses of soft matter materials.
Here, mathematical models like the kind we propose are crucial
because the model parameters control surface properties independently, 
which can be difficult to accomplish experimentaly 
~\cite{Bradley2016,Mallory2017,Bradley2017}.
The ability to translate phenomenological parameters
into measurable quantities is important. 
For example, Figure~\ref{fig:OrderPDFs} plots
the probability density function for 
relative orientation of adjacent particles
for the three boundary condition cases:
(a) is unimodal with a peak at $\theta = 0$,
(b) is bimodal with peaks at $\theta = 0$ and $\theta = \pi$,
and (c) is multimodal with peaks at $\theta = 0$ and $\theta = \pm \pi/2$.
This kind of information can be used as an indicator
of the collective morphology. As another example,
it is costly or difficult to manufacture
Janus particles with uniform shape.
Thus, we can replace the idealistic boundary
conditions \eqref{eq:bcs} with a more realistic one like
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:vonMises}
  g_i(\xx) = \sqrt{
  \frac{\exp( \kappa_i\cos(\theta_i(\xx) - \theta^0_i))}
  {2\pi r_i I_0(\kappa_i)}}.
\end{equation}
Here, the term under the square root is the von Mises distribution with
director angle $\theta^0_i$ and Bessel function $I_0$ of order zero~\cite{Fisher_1993}.
The square of this function is asymptotic to a normal distribution with variance
like $1/\kappa_i$, $\kappa_i \to \infty$. We can replicated surface imperfections
by randomizing the concentration $\kappa_i$ and particle radii $r_i$,
for example.

\subsubsection{Hydrophobic forces with double-well potential}
A natural generalization of the potential $f(u) = u^2$
is a fourth-order, asymmetric double-well potential
$f(u) = a(u-u_0)^2(u-u_1)^2 + c(u-u_0)^2 + bu$.
Here, the order parameter $u$ is related to
the mean number of nearest neighbors
per water molecule \cite{GoHaKo94}.
The value $u_0$ gives the absolute minimum in the bulk
and $u_1$ gives a local minimum at hydrophobic surfaces.
Figure \ref{fig:CA}(a) illustrates a double-well potential.


\begin{wrapfigure}[29]{l}{1.8in}
  \vspace{-4pt}

  \input{figures/doublewell.tikz} 
  \caption{\label{fig:CA} (a) The double well potential $u_0 =

  Allen-Cahn equation~\eqref{eq:SL}. (c) The convergence of the exact
  and inexact Newton's methods.}
\end{wrapfigure}
Equation~\eqref{eq:SL} takes the form of a steady-state Allen-Cahn
equation. The Allen-Cahn equation is used in phase field formulations of
immisible fluids, for example.
PI BQ has developed fast integral equation solvers for
the Allen-Cahn equation \cite{kro-qua2011, qua2011}.
PI RR has experience in the 
simulation and asymptotic analysis of phase field functionals of
membrane elastic energy, devising functionals for for the squared mean
curvature (Willmore) energy~\cite{0951-7715-18-3-016}, spontaneous
curvature~\cite{Du05} and Gaussian curvature energy~\cite{DuEuler}, as
well as energetic variational approaches to coupling membrane elasticity
to fluids~\cite{QiangDu09}.

The double-well formulation can potentially 
explain hydrophobic interaction over the full distance
regime~\cite{Lum1999, Lin2005, Meyer2006, Ducker2016}.
Motivated by capillary wetting, Gerhard
Gompper introduced the double-well model for one-dimensional
hydrophobic attraction \cite{GoHaKo94}.
The results improved on previous work~\cite{ErLjCl89,MaRa76},
but a realistic model of hydrophobic effect 
probably involves particle shapes in addition to distances of separation.
The key innovation in the model we propose is that when particles are
well-separated, the energetic cost for filling the interstitial region
with $u_1$-phase water is prohibitive and there is a phase shift from
the $u_0$ to $u_1$ water order---the attraction landscape is more or
less identical to the linear response theory. Conversely, when particles
are proximal, it becomes energetically favorable to coalesce
$u_1$-phases. This introduces a line tension for the phase transition
which is an effect not present in the one-dimensional model. 

Some of the model parameters connect directly
%connect to long-range decay lengths and energy cost of creating
%hydrophobic-water interfaces with established ranges of
to well-established experimental values. Other
parameters, like the details of the well structure,
are less well-understood and must be fit to the measured data.
This improved model will afford greater physical accuracy to
our simulations.
%The experimental data on hydrophobic attraction between 
%is well-established and the literature contains data for a number of
%solvents and hydrocarbon species.
%The experimental measurements
%are well-fit by a double exponential curve in the 10 to 100 nanometer range
%of separation. Below 10~nm, however, there is an amplification of force
%and the attraction follows a much steeper force law not accounted
%for by past phenomenoloical theories~\cite{Lin2005}.

%It may be the case that the double-well formulation recreates the long
%and short-range interactions. The advantage is that the two-dimensional
%simulations can replicate the experimental setup better than prior,
%one-dimensional theoretical work

Specific Aim 2 describes how we propose to deal with the nonlinear
equation~\eqref{eq:SL} numerically. Once we have established
implementations, we will consider further generalizations
of~\eqref{eq:free_energy}, for example to the Oseen-Frank energy for a
nematic liquid crystal~\cite{doi:10.1137/15M103844X,
Bartels,AIHPA_1997__66_4_411_0, deGennesProst,HaKiLi86,Virga}. For now,
Specific Aim 3 describes in detail how we plan to handle charges and
ions in solution.



%Other approaches may be required if the modified phenomenological
%theory does not recreate measurements.
%One such approach is to consider Gaussian fluctuation. Here, we expand
%the free energy
%functional around the saddle point solution. The fluctuation energy
%then involves calculation of the eigenfunctions of the second variation
%of the free energy. This accounts for the fact that experimental
%measurements are carried out at finite temperatures, where thermal
%fluctuations should ideally also be considered.

\begin{comment}
The goal of Specific Aim 1 is to characterize the material properties of
many-body, self-assembled amphiphiles.  For amphiphiles assembled into
bilayers, these properties are described by membrane continuum
mechanics.  Our goal is to map the parameters of the particle-based
model onto the elastic moduli from continuum theory.  Results from this
goal will facilitate simulators to use the hydrophobic attraction force
calculations to model bilayers with specific composition. These
calculations have provably less computational complexity than those of
molecular dynamics simulations and possess the molecular granularity
lacking from continuum models.

Hamm and Kozlov (HK) pioneered the modern theory of membrane continuum
mechanics~\cite{Hamm2000}, and their theory is widely used to describe
biological phenomena, including fission \cite{FrEsAkSh15, Maetal15,
PhysRevE.79.031926}, fusion \cite{ChKo08,
KoKo2002,Kuzmin7235,Aeffner2012}, poration~\cite{Gaetal20}, phase
boundaries, and interaction with inclusions~\cite{SeLeMaEg17,Saetal20,
Pietal20}. These phenomena require resolution of the internal structure
of the membrane.  Recently, there has been a revival of interest in the
HK theory as the quadratic assumption for the elasticity energy density
has caused researchers to question the applicability of the theory for
large curvatures~\cite{PhysRevLett.117.188102, ARGUDO20161619}.
%
\begin{wrapfigure}[11]{l}{0.47\textwidth}
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.46\textwidth]{Figures/Deformations.pdf}}
  \vspace{-5pt}
\caption{\label{fig:deformations} \footnotesize Sketch of the HK
 membrane model \cite{Hamm2000}.}
\end{wrapfigure}
%
This proposal will develop much-needed mathematical analysis to resolve
these controversies due to the assumptions in the HK theory. 


\sloppy
The HK framework assumes a three-dimensional lipid monolayer where the
internal structure consists of straight fibers that represent elongated
hydrocarbon chains.  The elastic energy density ${\cal W}$ is quadratic
in the Green-Lagrange strain tensor for this striated, internal
structure. This energy density decomposes into four, fundamental, and
independent deformations (Figure~\ref{fig:deformations}): splay ($\Div
{\bf n}$), twist ($\Curl {\bf n}$), saddle splay ($\det \nabla {\bf
n}$), and tilt ${\bf t}={\bf n}/({\bf N}\cdot {\bf n}) - {\bf N}$ where
${\bf N}$ is the unit surface normal;
\begin{equation}
\label{ansatz3}
{\cal W} \equiv \int_{\Sigma} 
  \tfrac{1}{2}\KB\left[ \left( \Div {\bf n} + k_0\right)^2 - k_0^2\right] 
+ \tfrac{1}{2}\KT (\Curl {\bf n})^2 + \KG  \det \nabla {\bf n} + \tfrac{1}{2}\KTH |{\bf t}|^2 \,dA.
\end{equation}
Here, the deformations come with elastic coefficients: the bending
modulus $\KB$, twist modulus $\KT$, saddle-splay modulus $\KG$, and tilt
modulus $\KTH$. The parameter $k_0$ is the spontaneous curvature and
determines the preferred lipid splay~\cite{RoLi15,Kozlov2007}.  

Although the HK elastic theory assumes small deformations, Galimzyanov
{\em et al.}~\cite{C9SM02079A} have shown that energies derived from
molecular dynamics and those derived from \eqref{ansatz3} are in
agreement, even when curvatures are large.  Under spatial scales much
larger than the membrane thickness, membrane energy is
well-characterized by the Canham-Helfrich energy used throughout the
fluid-structure literature \cite{QiangDu09, Lowengrub07,KimLai2010_JCP,
Hu, HuLaiSeolEtAl2016_JCP, qua-bir2014, qua-vee-you2019}. The
Canham-Helfrich energy is actually a special case of \eqref{ansatz3}
obtained by setting ${\bf n} =  \pm {\bf N}$ (the $\pm$ depending on
orientation) and collapsing both monolayers onto the membrane midplane.

\subsubsection{Simulations of the HAP model to estimate elastic moduli
and energy}
\begin{wrapfigure}[11]{r}{0.43\textwidth}
  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.42\textwidth]{Figures/Flattening.pdf}}
  \caption{\label{fig:flattening} \footnotesize Example of computing
  bending modulus of a lipid bilayer from particle simulation.}
\end{wrapfigure}
We propose to {\bf (i)} determine the value of effective elastic moduli
$\KB$, $\KT$, $\KG$, and $\KTH$ and then {\bf (ii)} understand how the
model parameters $\rho,$ $\gamma$, and the particle shape map onto
elastic moduli. An accurate and robust way to measure material
properties is to track the evolution of the bilayer as it relaxes from
an initially non-equilibrium
configuration~\cite{PhysRevLett.117.188102}.
Figure~\ref{fig:flattening} shows an example where the initial
configuration of a bilayer patch containing the splay deformation
without any other components (saddle splay, twist and tilt). As the bent
membrane flattens, both the self-interaction energy $\Phi$ and the
elastic energy ${\cal W}$ decrease, and because the saddle splay, twist,
and tilt stay zero, the slope gives the bending modulus in this case. 

Here we start with a particle-based bilayer in a specific
non-equilibrium shape that involves only one of the components of the
displacement in Figure~\ref{fig:deformations}, and then evolve the
particle system according to the time integration for \eqref{eq:stokes}.
Because elastic properties are independent of dissipation, we can forgo
solving for fluid velocity and set the translational velocity and
angular velocity directly proportional to the force and torque,
respectively. 

This yields a dissipation of the total potential \eqref{eq:total_poten},
which stabilizes the evolving bilayer shape. Therefore, we reconstruct
an evolving monolayer dividing surface $\Sigma$ and director field ${\bf
n}$ by interpolating the particle centers and orientations.
Using~\eqref{ansatz3}, we calculate a continuum energy $\mathcal{W}$
from the interpolated shapes.

We propose to conduct calculations similar to the example of
Figure~\ref{fig:flattening} for other elastic moduli such as the
effective twist modulus $\KT$.  Molecular dynamics investigations find a
twist modulus about 1 \kBT~\cite{LeVeWa14}, and here, the specific
non-equilibrium shape consists of a single layer of amphiphilic
particles on a hydrophobic substrate as illustrated by
Figure~\ref{fig:deformations}D. Having a nonzero twist requires nonzero
tilt because the surface gradient of the lipid director equals the
second fundamental form whenever tilt is zero locally. The twist
deformation is a fully three-dimensional deformation.
\S\ref{subsec:specific_aim_3} addresses outstanding implementation
issues like three-dimensional boundary integral equation solvers.

The gradient descent technique is ineffective for measuring the saddle
splay modulus $\KG$ because the saddle splay energy is largely invariant
under shape changes.  To evaluate $\KG$, we will combine the present
particle simulations with the string method from PI RR's work on
membrane fusion \cite{RyKlYaCo16}. The string method is a numerical
scheme that finds least energy pathways separating energy basins
\cite{doi:10.1063/1.2720838}.  In the simplified Canham-Helfrich
formulation, saddle splay energy is an exact indicator of topological
transitions, thanks to the  Gauss-Bonnet theorem \cite{TerziDeserno17}.
More generally, PI RR has shown that saddle splay acts as a topological
indicator even in the presence of nonzero tilt \cite{RyKlYaCo16}.  As a
result, saddle splay can be quantified from the transition energies of a
least energy path of pore formation (Figure~\ref{fig:saddle_splay}).

The field of membrane continuum mechanics still lacks consensus as to
whether HK energy is the appropriate functional for bilayer energy.
\textbf{(i)} Researchers have assumed that $\KT = 0$ to effect lateral
fluidity in membranes~\cite{Hamm2000, TerziDeserno17, C9SM02079A,
PhysRevE.102.042406}. A value $\KT = 0$, however, makes~\eqref{ansatz3}
a noncoercive functional. \textbf{(ii)} Recently,~\cite{TerziDeserno17}
derived a tilt curvature term that was neglected from the HK
analysis~\cite{Hamm2000}.  Later,~\cite{C9SM02079A}
and~\cite{PhysRevE.102.042406} independently identified an inconsistency
in the argument used by~\cite{TerziDeserno17} arising from a transversal
tilt invariance assumption.  In~\cite{RyKlYaCo16}, PI RR and
collaborators showed that the tilt vector leads to unphysical cusps
depending on how one accounts for membrane thickness.  \textbf{(iii)}
Theoretical analysis of lipid phase transitions predict a negative
saddle-splay modulus around $-8$ \kBT~\cite{SIEGEL2004366,
SIEGEL20085200} that gives rise to a larger energy barrier for monolayer
fusion than is found by experiments~\cite{FrRoPi17, Tran7106,
TerziDeserno17}.

The form of the elastic energy density~\eqref{ansatz3} is the same as
the Oseen-Frank energy density for nematic liquid
crystals~\cite{ANDRIENKO2018520, Tran7106, Helfrich73}. In fact, a lipid
monolayer acts as one layer in a smectic phase~\cite{REYESMATEO1995978,
Rangamani20140463, PhysRevLett.113.248102}. Based on this observation,
we propose to examine the HK analysis to resolve the aforementioned
inconsistencies. We will expand the strain tensor in terms of a plane
perpendicular to ${\bf n}$ (instead of the monolayer tangent plane as
done in the past works) so that the gradient terms in the elastic energy
completely decouple. Using this expansion we prove an exact identity
that gives the incompressibility condition by a Steiner-type polynomial
in $\Div {\bf n}$ and $\det \nabla {\bf n}$ \cite{Fe59}. In contrast,
the works~\cite{TerziDeserno17, PhysRevE.102.042406, Hamm2000,
C9SM02079A} utilize an approximate identity for incompressibility as a
base, so we can considerably improve upon the analysis of monolayer
energy.

\subsubsection{Analysis of the HAP model in terms of the HK functional}
The HK functional~\eqref{ansatz3} has transformed how scientists understand biological membranes, yet the
theory has received little attention in terms of
mathematical analysis. In the calculus of variations, the
principal question is whether a minimizer of an energy functional
exists. In the case of~\eqref{ansatz3}, the answer is presently unknown.
With regard to the simpler Canham-Helfrich energy,~\cite{Simon1993}
proved the existence of minimizing surfaces without boundary,
and~\cite{doi:10.1137/18M1195851} proved the well-posedness of a
spatially periodic, time-dependent elastic interface problem. An
analytical challenge for the HK functional~\eqref{ansatz3} is that
surface-director coupling makes it possible to have bounded energy
monolayers with corners, and such pathological examples must be ruled
out before carrying over the arguments for the Canham-Helfrich
functional to the present setting.

Our goal here is to develop tools that can explain functionals
like~\eqref{ansatz3} from first principles in terms of HAP. The
papers~\cite{doi:10.1063/5.0009734, Seguin2012, Seguin2014} give
statistical mechanical/mean field derivations of the Canham-Helfrich
energy from a pair-potential for rod-like molecules, but do not include
tilt, which is an indispensable deformation at biological scales. To
make progress, we must first understand how the HAP functional behaves
under various limits.

We first consider HAP in the limit of vanishing screening length. As a
concrete model problem, we consider a collection of colloidal polyhedral
where the binding energy of this system can be described by a discrete,
lower semicontinuous functional $\Phi_0$ whose value is the total
surface area of the polyhedra minus two times the area of any
overlapping faces. We conjecture that the $\Phi$ energy
$\Gamma$-converges to $\Phi_0$ \cite{Mugnai2013}, meaning that any
cluster points of minimizers of $\Phi$ converge to a minimum of $\Phi_0$
in the limit $\rho \to 0$. To address this conjecture, we employ
boundary layer analysis for the screened Laplace equation~\cite{Lee2018,
Lin2015, Shibata2004,1531-3492_2006_2_357, Lee2018}. The technique of
$\Gamma$-convergence is a powerful tool for numerical approximations and
with it we can help explain unexpected phenomena like hierarchical
self-assembly in colloidal systems~\cite{Luo2019}.
