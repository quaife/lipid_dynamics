Over the past decade, there has been an explosion of interest in
small-scale processes that utilize capillary forces and van der Waals
interactions to coordinate movement and bind microscopic components in
solvent~\cite{Pandey2011, Zhang2017, Siontorou2017}. Additionally,
hydrodynamic interactions are central to fabricate complex,
three-dimensional microstructures~\cite{Dasgupta2017, Leong2007,
Reynolds2019, Cho2010}. Hydrodynamic effects cannot be ignored since
they, like for the rates of biological functions like pore
dynamics~\cite{RYHAM20112929}, set the rate of dissipation. In Specific
Aim 2, we propose novel and efficient high-order numerical methods to
simulate dynamic assembly of particles under the HAP in a viscous
solvent. As described in~\eqref{eqn:stokes} and illustrated in
Figure~\ref{fig:flow_map}, the solvent phase is modeled by the Stokes
equations for an incompressible, viscous fluid, and these equations are
coupled to the non-linear screened-Laplace equation~\eqref{eqn:phase}
through viscous and hydrophobic stress balance.

%\end{wrapfigure}
The HAP model requires solving exterior problems for the order
parameter~\eqref{eqn:phase} and the Stokes equations~\eqref{eqn:stokes}.
We will develop methods based on combinations of volume and layer
potentials, and inexact Newton's method. As mentioned in
Section~\ref{sec:bie}, numerical methods to solve these integral
equations (IEs) have several advantages over their PDE-based
counterpart. The PIs have demonstrated that IEs are a powerful tool to
simulate two-dimensional suspensions of amphiphilic
particles~\cite{Fu2018_SIAM, FuQuRyYo22, fu-ryh-qua-you2022}, and
elements of these formulations have been developed in three
dimensions~\cite{ying_2006, manasthesis, rac-gre2016}. This proposal
will extend the two-dimensional methods to more general amphiphilic
particle models and also to three dimensions. In addition, the methods
will allow us to use results we have shown for $\mathcal{O}(100)$
granules, and extend them to suspensions with 100X--1000X more granules.
These methods will be motivated by models and analysis developed in
Specific Aims 1 and 3. \S\ref{subsec:AC} describes how the non-linear
equation for the order parameter~\eqref{eqn:phase} will be iteratively
solved using an IE formulation. Then, \S\ref{subsec:NumericalIssues}
describes how we will combine accurate quadrature and fast summation
methods to accelerate the time to accurate solutions. A natural
extension to create simulations that are realizable by experimentalists
is to include confinement, and this is discussed in
\S\ref{subsec:Confinement}. This extension will also allow us to develop
new rheological properties of the suspensions.  Finally,
\S\ref{subsec:timeStepping} proposes collision-aware adaptive time
stepping methods.

\subsubsection{An inexact Newton solver for the phase transition PDE}
\label{subsec:AC}

  \caption{\label{fig:CA} \footnotesize (a) A double well potential. (b)
  The solution of the one-dimensional phase
  transition~\eqref{eqn:phase}. (c) The convergence of exact and inexact
  Newton's methods.}
\end{wrapfigure}
The PIs have developed numerical methods to solve~\eqref{eqn:phase} when
$W(\phi) = \phi^2$---this choice results in the linear screened Laplace
equation. For a general double well potential $W$ with local minima at
$\phi_0$ and $\phi_1$, we propose to interpret the solution as the root
finding problem for
\begin{align}
  \label{eqn:phaseRoot}
  J[\phi] = -\epsilon^2 \Delta \phi + \tfrac{1}{2}W'(\phi).
\end{align}
Equation~\eqref{eqn:phaseRoot} will be solved with Newton's method,
$\phi^{N+1} = \phi^{N} - \alpha (dJ^N)^{-1} J(\phi^N)$, where $dJ^N =
-\epsilon^2 \Delta + \tfrac{1}{2}W''(\phi^N)$ is the Fr\'{e}chet
derivative of $F$, and $\alpha$ is the step size that will be determined
using backtracking. This requires solving the variable coefficient PDE
$-\epsilon^2 \Delta v + \tfrac{1}{2}W''(\phi^{N}) v = J[\phi^N]$, which
is challenging with an integral equation since a fundamental solution is
not readily available. However, by choosing a double well potential with
$W''(\phi_0) = W''(\phi_1) = \beta$, we propose to instead use an
inexact Newton's method where $dJ^{-1}$ is approximated with the
solution of $-\epsilon^2 \Delta v + \tfrac{\beta}{2} v = J[\phi^N]$. We
test the efficacy of the exact and inexact Newton's method applied
to~\eqref{eqn:phaseRoot} in $(0,1) \subset \RR$ by discretizing $dJ$
with a second-order finite difference stencil. The double well potential
is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:CA}(a), and both the exact and inexact
Newton's methods converge to the solution in Figure~\ref{fig:CA}(b).
Figure~\ref{fig:CA}(c) shows the norm of the residual at each Newton
iterate when using the exact second derivative (red curve) and the
approximate second derivative (blue curve). While the inexact Newton's
method requires roughly twice as many iterations to reach of a tolerance
of $10^{-4}$, each iteration is significantly cheaper to apply.

Having demonstrated that the inexact Newton method converges in one
dimension, it will be coupled with IE formulations to
solve~\eqref{eqn:phase} in two and three dimensions. The solution of
$-\epsilon^2 \Delta v + \tfrac{\beta}{2} v = J[\phi^N]$ can be written
as $v = v^P + v^H$ where $v^P$ is a volume potential and $v^H$ is a
homogeneous solution of the PDE, which is represented as a layer
potential, and is used to satisfy the boundary condition. The volume
potential is
\begin{align*}
  v^{P}(\xx) = \int_{\Omega(t)} G(\xx,\yy) J[\phi^N](\yy)\, d\yy, 
    \quad \xx \in \Omega(t),
\end{align*}
where $G$ is the fundamental solution of $-\epsilon^2 \Delta +
\tfrac{\beta}{2}$. Traditionally, volume potentials are more challenging
to compute than layer potentials, but new methods have recently been
developed that allows them to be computed accurately and
efficiently~\cite{fry-leh-tor2018, and-zhu-vee2022}. This approach of
combining volume and layer potentials has successfully been used by PI
BQ~\cite{kro-qua2010} and others~\cite{fry-kro-tor2019, kli-ask-kro2020,
che-hua-lei2005}.

\subsubsection{Increased accuracy and reduced CPU time}
\label{subsec:NumericalIssues}
While IE formulations of PDEs have several advantages, several
challenges must be overcome before the code can be used to simulate
systems with large numbers of granules. For example, when granules are
close to one another, which is inevitable in dense suspensions, the
resulting integrals are nearly-singular. This issue is well-known in the
IE community and several algorithms have been developed in the last 30
years. An incomplete list of methods that address near-singular
integration include panel-based methods~\cite{helsing_2008a,
helsing_tutorial_2012}, Quadrature by Expansions
(QBX)~\cite{din-hua-mar-tan2021, klo-bar-gre-one2013, ste-bar2022,
af2018sisc}, and interpolation-based methods~\cite{ying_2006,
qua-bir2014, rah-vee-zor-bir2015}. The proposed research, which is
described next,  will combine several methods including singularity
subtraction, analytic function theory, and spherical basis
representations.

In two-dimensions, analytic function theory can be used to derive a
quadrature method whose error is uniformly bounded~\cite{bar2014,
bar-wu-vee2015, ioa-pap-per1991}, but these works only show how to apply
the method to the two-dimensional Laplace and Stokes equations. PI BQ
recently showed that these quadrature methods can be extended to other
PDEs with singularity subtraction~\cite{che-lin-her-qua2022}. For
example, the fundamental solution of the screened Laplace
equation~\eqref{eqn:phase} involves the modified Bessel function of the
second kind, $K_0(\|\xx - \yy\|)$. The behavior of this function as $\yy
\rightarrow \xx$ is $K_0(\alpha \|\xx - \yy\|) = \log\|\xx - \yy\| +
S(\xx - \yy)$, where $S(\xx - \yy)$ is continuously differentiable. This
suggests a quadrature scheme for where the aforementioned quadrature
method is applied to the $\log\|\xx - \yy\|$ kernel, and high-order
methods~\cite{tre-wei2014} are applied to integrals involving the smooth
kernel $S(\xx - \yy)$.Similar techniques, which they call subtraction
techniques, have been considered by Camille Carvalho and her
colleagues~\cite{car2021, car2020, car-kha-kim2018}.  These methods are
particularly powerful when computing gradients of layer potentials which
is required, for example, when computing the water-order
stress~\eqref{eqn:stressbalance}.

In three dimensions, the quadrature methods are much more challenging.
Singularity subtraction methods can be applied, but analytic function
theory is no longer applicable. Singularity subtraction methods have
been applied using, for example, smoothed variations of
the~\cite{beale1, cor2001, tlu-bea2019}. Alternatively, efficient
quadrature methods can be applied directly to accurately compute
singular and near-singular integrals~\cite{khayat_2005,
gimbutas2013sisc}. However, since we are interested in round (2D) and
spherical (3D) granules, we will exploit the fact that integrals can be
computed exactly after transforming the integrals to to a Fourier (2D)
or spherical harmonic (3D) basis. This technique can be used to evaluate
layer potentials for both Stokes~\cite{cor-vee2018} and the screened
Laplace equation~\cite{koh-cor-che-vee2021}.

Another facet to consider when choosing the quadrature rule is its
ability to be applied efficiently. Since carefully chosen IE
formulations require a mesh-independent number of GMRES
iterations~\cite{cam-ips-kel-mey-xue1996}, the required CPU time is
proportional to the cost of a matrix-vector multiplication that can be
performed in optimal or near-optimal time with the fast multipole method
(FMM)~\cite{fmm5} and its extensions~\cite{fmm1, fmm2, fmm3, fmm4, fmm6,
fmm7, ros-ols2016}. PI BQ is experienced with applying FMMs for the
Stokes equation~\cite{qua-bir2014, bys-sha-qua2020} and the screened
Laplace equation~\cite{kro-qua2011, qua2011}. Many of these methods rely
on analytic expansions of the PDE's fundamental solution, but recent
work has demonstrated that a kernel-independent method applied to
suspensions of 80,000 spheres can be simulated with only $\sim$10
seconds per time step on 1792 compute cores~\cite{Yan2019}.

%
%Furthermore, to reduce the
%number of GMRES iterations, the efficacy of preconditioning strategies
%such as the inverse Fast Multipole Method (IFMM)~\cite{cou-pou-dar2017}
%and domain decomposition~\cite{che-bir2021} will be investigated. PI BQ
%used the IFMM to precondition Stokes equations~\cite{qua-cou-dar2018}. A
%suite of other preconditioners including sparse approximate
%inverses~\cite{che2000} and multigrid~\cite{hem-sch1981, sch1982} will
%be investigated.

% ----------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Incorporating confinement}
\label{subsec:Confinement}
In experiments, it is known that interactions between bounding walls and
granules cannot be ignored~\cite{qua-gan-you2021,
KaouiHartingMisbah2011_PRE, her-sto-gra2005}. Therefore, the necessary
modifications to the code will be performed so that confinement can be
considered. PI BQ has considered suspensions with confinement for
several projects including dynamic suspensions~\cite{qua-bir2014,
bys-sha-qua2020} and porous media~\cite{chi-moo-qua2020,
dea-qua-bir-jua2018, moo-che-chi-qua2022, qua-gan-you2021}.


% ----------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Collision-aware suspensions with adaptive time stepping}
\label{subsec:timeStepping}

A numerical issue when simulating the self-assembly of amphiphilic
particles is avoiding particle collision. The hydrophobic attraction
potential drives the amphiphilic particles towards one another and this
leads to physical contact in finite time. Such particle collisions in a
dense, rigid-body suspension are a great challenge and can be a
bottleneck in large-scale simulations. We propose to remedy this
computational challenge by developing novel high-order adaptive time
stepping methods. PI BQ developed a high-order adaptive time
stepping method for hydrodynamic suspensions \cite{qua-bir2016}, and it
has served as a robust method to simulate processes including mixing and
adhesion in suspensions~\cite{qua-vee-you2019, kab-qua-bir2017}.
Following this previous work, the proposed work will use a spectral
deferred correction method~\cite{dut-gre-rok2000} since it iteratively
applies a low-order, single-step method to achieve high-order accuracy.
At each time step, we will compute the total force and torque of the
system which is computationally cheap and physically zero, and therefore
provides an estimate of the local truncation error. PI BQ's experience
is that error estimates based on physical constraints, such as force-
and torque-free conditions, appropriately determine adaptive time step
sizes so that the dynamics are resolved without the computational
expense of embedded Runge-Kutta methods, step-doubling, Richardson
extrapolation.
