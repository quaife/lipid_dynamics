\section{Relevant Results from Prior NSF Support}
\label{sec:prior}
\noindent {\bf Rolf Ryham}: no prior NSF support.

\noindent
{\bf Yuan-Nan Young}: {\em NSF-DMS-1222550, Mathematical and
experimental study of lipid bilayer shape and dynamics mediated by
surfactants and proteins}, \$212,603, 9/15/2012 - 08/31/2016 (with
no-cost extension), PI. {\em Intellectual merit:} The focus of this
grant is modeling the interaction between a pure lipid bilayer membrane
with surfactant, cholesterol, and protein.

\noindent
{\em Broader impacts:} 
One PhD student (Szu-Pei Fu) was funded to work with PI Young, and work
has resulted in seven papers~\cite{Nganguia2013_PoF, Nganguia2013_PRE,
Young2014_JFM, Young2015_PoF, Nganguia2015_CiCP, Pak2015_PNAS,
fu2015pre}. 
%PI Young has been actively involved with promotion of
%underrepresented students at NJIT. One PhD student, Herve Nganguia, is
%now an Assistant Professor at Towson University. PI Young has taught a
%broad spectrum of courses in fluid mechanics and applied math modeling.

\noindent
{\bf Bryan Quaife}: {\em NSF DMS-2012560, Erosion, Transport, and
Dispersion in Granular and Porous Media}, \$249,636,
08/01/2020--07/31/2023, PI. {\em Intellectual Merit:} The goal of this
research is to develop high-order numerical methods to
simulate hydrological processes including erosion.

\noindent
{\em Broader impacts:} 
A third-year PhD student (Jake Cherry) has been assigned to this
project. One paper has been accepted~\cite{che-lin-her-qua2022} and
another is under review~\cite{moo-che-chi-qua2022}.

PI Quaife is responsible for the overall management of the project.
The research work is structured to meet the tasks
in \S\ref{sec:proposed-work}. The PIs and students will meet
by video conference and in person when possible. PI Ryham and PI Young
will conduct biweekly meetings in person, with PI Quaife joining over
video conference from Florida. 
%The PIs will share software packages, paper sources,
%and references on a common \textsf{Git} repository. 
Documents and 
software will be managed and shared on \textsf{Github}.

The detailed schedule for the proposed work is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:schedule}. Each PI will spearhead a Specific Aim, and
program management will happen throughout, with special coordination
taken in quarters 4, 8, and 12.
