\section{Background}

\textbf{Very broad introduction}

\subsubsection{Problem formulation}

The mathematical formulation is a nonlinear system for the dynamics of a
collection of particles. The interactions come from a system of 
partial differential equations (PDEs) that comprise hydrodynamic
interactions and hydrophobic interactions.
%The formulation prevents particle collisions through excluded volume
%potentials. 
The hydrodynamic interactions come from the mobility problem for rigid
particles immersed in a viscous solvent. We then use a
second-order Adams-Bashforth method to update the particle configuration.
Assuming inertial terms are
negligible, the particle motion is goverened by the Stokes equations
\begin{subequations}
  \label{eq:stokes}
  \begin{alignat}{3}
  \label{eq:stokes1}
  -\mu \Delta \uu + \nabla p &= \mathbf{0}, && \xx \in \Omega, \\
    \label{eq:stokes2}
  \nabla\cdot \uu &= 0, \qquad && \xx \in \Omega, \\
\label{eq:stokes3}
  \uu - \uu_\infty &\to \mathbf{0}, && |\xx| \to \infty,
  \end{alignat}
\end{subequations}
%\begin{alignat}{3}
%\label{eq:stokes1}
%  -\mu \Delta \uu + \nabla p &= \mathbf{0}, 
%    && \xx \in \Omega, \\
%\label{eq:stokes2}
%  \nabla\cdot \uu &= 0, \qquad && \xx \in \Omega, \\
%\label{eq:stokes3}
%  \uu - \uu_\infty &\to \mathbf{0}, && |\xx| \to \infty,
%\end{alignat}
%
where $\uu$ is the velocity and $p$ is the pressure of the solvent,
$\uu_\infty$ is the background flow, and $\mu$ is the constant solvent
viscosity. The domain $\Omega = \Omega(t)$ is the fluid region surrounding the
particles and changes shape as the particles move.
Since the particles are rigid, the solvent velocity satisfies
a no-slip boundary condition for a rigid body motion 
%\begin{align}
%\label{eq:rigid_bc}
%  \uu(\xx) = \vv_i + \omega_i  (\xx - \aa_i)^\perp, \quad
%    \xx \in \Gamma_i,\qquad  i=1,\ldots,N_p,
%\end{align}
on the particle boundary $\Gamma_i$ with translational velocity $\vv_i$
and angular velocity $\omega_i$ (Figure \ref{fig:flow_map}).
Given imposed forces acting on each
particle, the \emph{mobility problem} consists of finding
translational and angular velocities so that viscous fluid forces
balance the imposed forces.

The hydrophobic interactions come from the tendency of particles to
minimize the free energy of the structure of the surrounding water
molecules. The free energy functional takes the form 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:free_energy}
  F[u] = C \int_{\Omega} \left(\rho |\nabla u|^2 + \rho^{-1} f(u)\right)
  \,d\xx,
\end{equation}
where $u$ is an order parameter for the structure of water, $\rho$ is a
decay length, $C$ is a constant, and $f(u)$ is a potential.
Hydrogen-bond persistence times are on the order of picoseconds
which is much smaller than characteristic time for 
particle motion \cite{MaGa13}.
Thus we assume $u$ minimizes $F[u]$ for all times.
Assuming appropriate conditions on $f(u)$ (\cite{evans10}, \S 8.2),
$u$ is bounded and satisfies the Euler-Lagrange equation
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:SL}
-\rho^2 \Delta u + \tfrac{1}{2}f'(u) = 0  \text{ in } \Omega,\quad u = g,
\text{ on } \bd\Omega.
\end{equation}
The boundary condition $g$ is a material label that is transported with
the particle (Figure~\ref{fig:bcs}).

The particles lower the free energy $F[u]$ of the surrounding water
by moving. We calculate the rate of change of $F[u]$ using
\emph{variation of the domain} ~\cite{Fu2018_SIAM,Bandle2015, Schiffer1954, Grinfeld2010}.
Carrying out
this variation yields a 
%The hydrophobic forces are torques are
%\begin{equation}
%  \label{eq:hydrophobicAttraction}
%  \FF_i^{\text{hydro}} = \int_{\Gamma_i} {\bf T}\cdot \nnu \, \dif s, 
%    \quad 
%    T_i^{\text{hydro}} = \int_{\Gamma_i} (\xx - \aa_i)^{\perp} \cdot
%    ({\bf T} \cdot \nnu) \dif s.
%\end{equation}
stress  
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:stress}
\mathbf{T}
= C \left[ \rho^{-1} f(u) \mathbf{I}
  + \rho \left(|\nabla u|^2 \mathbf{I} - 2\nabla u \nabla u^T\right)\right].
\end{align}
The imposed forces and torques come from the integration of $\mathbf{T}$
along the particle boundary.
These forces and torques couple the Stokes equations \eqref{eq:stokes},
to semilinear elliptic equation \eqref{eq:SL}.
Solving for the translational and rotational velocities gives the
particle evolution.

   The arrows are the velocity field $\mathbf{u}$.

The stress~\eqref{eq:stress} was first
introduced by~\cite{Fu2018_SIAM} and is the higher-dimensional
generalization of disjoining pressure \cite{MaRa76, ErLjCl89, KoNa15,
Nagle17, KUZMIN2005}. It is the mathematical ingredient responsible for
forming particle aggregates that sequester their hydrophobic surface
regions (Figure \ref{fig:3particles}).

%By solving the above system, we obtain translational and angular
%velocities of the many-body system. A second-order Adams-Bashforth
%scheme updates the particle positions and orientations.

The formulation presents a number of mathematical and numerical
challenges. For one, the domain is constantly changing so that a new
boundary value problem must be solved at each time step. The particle
boundaries are nearly touching and high-order numerical
schemes and adaptively chosen time-step sizes
are required to calculate trajectories accurately.
Furthermore, the domain is unbounded and care must be taken 
in capturing the far-field boundary conditions correctly. 
Finally, the numerical routine must handle large system sizes
efficiently.

%\begin{equation}
%  \label{eq:force}
%  \int_{\Gamma_i} \ssigma \cdot \nnu \, \dif s = \FF_i,\quad 
%  \int_{\Gamma_i} (\xx - \aa_i)^{\perp} \cdot (\ssigma \cdot \nnu) \,
%  \dif s = T_i, \qquad i=1,\ldots,N_b,
%\end{equation}
%where
%$\ssigma = -p \mathbf{I} + \mu \left(\nabla \uu + \nabla \uu^T \right)$
%is the hydrodynamic stress tensor (pressure tensor) and $\nnu$ is the
%particle outward normal.
