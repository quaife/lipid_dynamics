\section{Broader Impacts}
\label{sec:BroaderImpacts}
This project aims to advance the mathematical modeling of collective dynamics of amphiphilic particles. The simulations use a new, yet intuitive, approach that accounts for important and complex systems that are presently out of reach in computational material science. These complex systems include optimal shape design in metamaterials and fusion and fission of amphiphilic bilayer membranes. The models describing colloidal systems could be transformative in biomedicine and material science. The research draws from expertise in scientific computing, physics of fluids, and mathematics. The mathematical component incorporates leading variational techniques and offers insight into fundamentals of material science. The project brings socially consequential research into the classroom and offers 
undergraduates the opportunity to train alongside faculty and graduate students. With its combination of mathematical modeling, analysis, and scientific computing, the project highlights the importance of mathematics and computation to all areas of science and engineering.


\subsection{Educational Impacts}
\label{subsec:Educational_plans}
To foster training in mathematical sciences,
the proposal supports two undergraduate researchers (URs) per year
from the lead institution.
PI Ryham has worked side-by-side and
published with undergraduate coauthors in
\cite{RYHAM20112929, RyWaCo13, RyKlYaCo16}.
He is presently mentoring a Clare Boothe Luce Scholar 
on mathematical analysis of trends in election redistricting.
With another Fordham supported UR,
he is finishing a paper on a closed-form 
energy density for translationally invariant bilayers. 
Based on these experiences, we have outlined three projects for the present proposal.
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
%\noitemsep
\item Translate project code from MATLAB into a compiled language   

\item Use machine learning to post-process data from the Janus particle self-assembly

\item Mathematically investigate self-assembly in the zero-screen-length limit
  
\end{enumerate}
The UR support is for eight summer weeks. 
In addition to collaborating with the PI,
they will have tutorials and receive training in
mathematical writing and presentation.
The URs will have desks and meeting room
in a recently completed collaboration space
built for the Mathematics Department. 
As a condition of support, 
they will be required to write a summary report and
give a presentation in the university's undergraduate
research symposium.  The PI 
will encourage the
URs to participate in a national conference.

To meaningfully engage the community, the PIs will prioritize students
coming from underrepresented groups and specifically target students
whose socio-economic background prevents them from participating in
out-of-state research experiences.  PI Ryham will solicit applicants
from Fordham University's Collegiate Science and Technology Entry
Program.  Students from the Bronx High School of Science (PI Ryham) and
Newark Science Park High School (PI Young) will also be encouraged to
join the research team. PI Quaife will work with undergraduates and high
school students through the Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program
and Young Scholar's Program, as he has done in the past.

To maximize vertical integration, the PIs and personnel
will travel to New York for one or two weeks during the summers.
Finally, we will create several modules to include in our courses. These
modules will introduce topics from numerical linear algebra and
optimization and highlight concrete applications of mathematics
based on the ideas of the proposal.

\section{Intellectual Merit}
\label{sec:IntellectualMerit}
The purpose of this research is to reach interesting physical phenomena with less computational cost than molecular dynamics, and account for more general features that continuum theory misses. The main ingredient is defining a nonlocal interaction through the solution of an elliptic boundary value problem that has the phenomenological characteristics of long-range hydrophobic attraction. This minimal model, while intuitive, is quite a general description of amphiphiles in solvent and gives rise to rich phenomena from Janus particle aggregates to correctly predicting elastic properties of bilayer. The technical research tasks include quantifying collective properties of amphiphilic ensembles, improving on mathematical models, efficient, high-order numerical algorithms for large-scale simulations, and incorporating external fields through electric charge.
