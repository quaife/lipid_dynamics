\section{Preliminary work}
\label{sec:preliminary_work}
The HAP project was initiated in 2017 by PIs RR and YNY.
The lead author on our first paper (\cite{Fu2018_SIAM}) was Szu-Pei Fu,
who was PI YNS's PhD student and is currently a postdoc with PI RR.
The collaboration involved theoretical work and simulation. The theoretical
work included model development, proving the first variation formula
\eqref{stress} and force-free law, and an energy-based  uniqueness
theorem for the exterior domain problem \eqref{SL}.
Coauthors Andreas Kl\"ockner (Computer Science, UIUC, NSF CAREER \#1654756)
and his PhD student Matt Wala provided their Quadrature by Expansion, or QBX
algorithm and Fu ran simulations on NJIT clusters.   

The simulation results were encouraging. The small particle-number
simulations successfully demonstrated gradient-driven self-assembly of amphiphilic
particles into two-dimensional micelles, bilayer membranes. The model parameters
where the decay length $\rho$, interfacial tension $\gamma$, particle geometry, and
repulsion strength. The particle diamaters were set equal to monolayer thickness, 2.0 nm \cite{Boal}, and we chose a repulsion strength that gave adequate interparticle spacing.
For the decay length, we used $\rho = 2.5$ nm based on measurements of hydrophobic
attraction between surfactant-coated \cite{Eriksson1989,Lin2005,Parsegian,Israelachvili80}.
For the interfacial tension, we used $\gamma = 4$ pN nm$^{-1}$
based on measurements for single-component bilayer lipid membranes
\cite{GarciaSaez, KUZMIN2005, Petelska2012, Jackson2016}.

We performed three types of simulations. The first measured bending by loading
a planar bilayer. The second used a harmonic bond to dilate a circular bilayer.
The third measured tilt using a decay equation from  \cite{KUZMIN2005}.
These simulations isolated the deformations of \eqref{ansatz3}, enabling
us to read off elastic moduli from simulation data. 
The results agreed remarkably well with the values reported in the experimental literature, 
Table~\ref{tab:moduli}. The agreement is underscored by the fact
that the two, main HAP parameters $\gamma$ and $\rho$ were assigned
physical values from the outset, rather than being tuned. 



\subsection{Two-dimensional vesicle hydrodynamics in shear flow} 
%The motion of vesicles in shear flow is an important problem in the
%applied mathematics because simulations can reveal mechanical
%properties of membranes and lead to an enhanced understanding of
%deformable particle laden flows \cite{Sinha15}.

%
To implement a vesicle in shear flow in the context of hydrophobic
potentials and mobility problem, we consider a shear flow in the
far-field $\mathbf{u}_{\infty} = Uy\mathbf{i}_x$ in the direction of the
$x$-axis (Figure \ref{fig:tanktreading}A). As illustrated in Figure
\ref{fig:tanktreading}, the particle based approach supports
inter-leaflet slip, and this can be used to determine inter-leaflet and
in-plane shear viscosities. 
%
%This field satisfies the linear Stokes system but does not give rise to a rigid motion at the particle interfaces. 
%To have a rigid motion, we change variables $\mathbf{u} = \tilde{\mathbf{u}}+ \mathbf{u}_{\infty}$ and 
%for the new field $\tilde{\mathbf{u}}$ vanishing at infinity we let 
%$\tilde{\mathbf{u}}|_{\partial P_i} = \mathbf{v}_i + \boldsymbol{\omega}_i \times (\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{a}_i)$ 
%where $(\mathbf{v}_i,\boldsymbol{\omega}_i)$ are the unknown translation and angular velocities of the 
%$i$th particle $P_i.$

The HAP simulations show vesicle tank-treading. Under the external shear flow, the initially circular 
vesicle rotates in the clockwise direction. As the rate of rotation increases, the vesicle approaches
a steadily tank-treading ellipse. In Figure \ref{fig:tanktreading}B-D, the solid curves are ellipses fit to the particle centers
and midplane respectively. In the non-dimensionalized system, the particles have diameter 2, on the order of $\rho,$ 
and the vesicle diameter is about 14. 
%\todo[inline]{missing units. nm?}
Figure~\ref{fig:tanktreading}E shows the aspect ratio of the major to minor axes reaching an equilibrium value in the 
red and blue curves, yet oscillating in the high-shear rate (yellow) curve.
The tank-treading vesicle elongates and becomes more horizontal 
with an increase in flow rate or 
with a decrease in stiffness (effected by decreasing $\rho = 4$ to $\rho = 2$). 


For large shear flow rates, there is an increase in arc length. Here arc
length refers to the the mid-plane circumference. Thus, some of the
external force is going into stretching the vesicle---the other part is
going into bending and viscous dissipation. From our experiments, we
find that the vesicle ruptures once stretching exceeds about 5 \% (see
Figure \ref{fig:rupture}). Finally, movies of the tank-treading motion
show a slip velocity between the outer and inner leaflets Figure
\ref{fig:tanktreading}G. We have illustrated this by tracking the
distance between two reference particles in the inner and outer leaflet
(Figure \ref{fig:tanktreading}B \& D, green and blue particles). With
moderate shear rates or greater adhesion, the particle pair moves in
tandem (in Figure \ref{fig:tanktreading}H, blue and red curves, their
distance is more or less constant). For a large shear rate, the
particle separates as the two leaflets slide against one another.
