	Abstract = {The interfaces of neat water and aqueous solutions play a prominent role in many technological processes and in the environment. Examples of aqueous interfaces are ultrathin water films that cover most hydrophilic surfaces under ambient relative humidities, the liquid/solid interface which drives many electrochemical reactions, and the liquid/vapor interface, which governs the uptake and release of trace gases by the oceans and cloud droplets. In this article we review some of the recent experimental and theoretical advances in our knowledge of the properties of aqueous interfaces and discuss open questions and gaps in our understanding.},

@article{Ducker2016,
	Abstract = {Thirty years ago there was considerable excitement over the first report of a long-ranged "hydrophobic force" between solids that were not wet by water (Israelachvili and Pashley, Nature 1982, 300, 341-342). Many of the subsequent measurements have been reexamined and found not to support the existence of a long-range hydrophobic force. The principal difficulty was that hydrophobic solids frequently experience other forces, which obscured or were mistaken for a hydrophobic force. In this paper, we review the surviving evidence for a long-range hydrophobic force and find that there is only supporting evidence in a total of two papers, one old and one new, where net attractive forces were measured at separations greater than about 5-6 nm. Thus the evidence is scarce. In contrast there are new experiments showing no such force, thereby arguing against the universality of a measureable hydrophobic force beyond about 6 nm. Since solvent water is common to the experiments, such evidence makes it difficult to describe a universal mechanism for a long-ranged hydrophobic force based on water structure. There are also new measurements that are consistent with a hydrophobic force with a decay length in the range 0.3-1.0 nm. In particular, attractive forces have been measured on small radius surfaces (8-50 nm) consistent with a hydrophobic force with a decay length of 0.5-0.6 nm, and a variety of net repulsive measurements are consistent with an attractive hydrophobic force that has a decay length of 0.3-1.0 nm. We also discuss some new measurements, which are consistent with cavitation, and not a surface force that acts at a distance.},

	Abstract = {It is shown theoretically and experimentally that a liquid droplet can move on a surface structured with a locally asymmetric pattern when a breathing of the drop is induced by external means. Two different situations can be envisioned: a drop whose volume is modulated and a drop whose equilibrium contact angle is switched between two extreme values. This last case was experimentally investigated using electric fields acting on water droplets in castor oil. The main trends of the theory are verified although a quantitative analysis would necessitate either a simpler experimental geometry or a more elaborate model.

@article{Arenas2019,
	Abstract = {Direct numerical simulations of two superposed fluids in a channel with a textured surface on the lower wall have been carried out. A parametric study varying the viscosity ratio between the two fluids has been performed to mimic both idealised super-hydrophobic and liquid-infused surfaces and assess its effect on the frictional, form and total drag for three different textured geometries: Longitudinal square bars, transversal square bars and staggered cubes. The interface between the two fluids is assumed to be slippery in the streamwise and spanwise directions and not deformable in the vertical direction, corresponding to the ideal case of infinite surface tension. To identify the role of the fluid-fluid interface, an extra set of simulations with a single fluid has been carried out. Comparison with the cases with two fluids reveals the role of the interface in suppressing turbulent transport between the lubricating layer and the overlying flow decreasing the overall drag. In addition, the drag and the maximum wall-normal velocity fluctuations were found to be highly correlated for all the surface configurations, whether they reduce or increase the drag. This implies that the structure of the near-wall turbulence is dominated by the total shear and not by the local boundary condition of the super-hydrophobic, liquid infused or rough surfaces.},

	Abstract = {Cell-penetrating and some antimicrobial peptides can translocate across lipid bilayers without disrupting the membrane structure. However, the molecular properties required for efficient translocation are not fully understood. We employed the Metropolis Monte Carlo method together with coarse-grained models to systematically investigate free-energy landscapes associated with the translocation of secondary amphiphilic peptides. We studied $\alpha$-helical peptides with different length, amphiphilicity, and distribution of hydrophobic content and found a common translocation path consisting of adsorption, tilting, and insertion. In the adsorbed state, the peptides are parallel to the membrane plane, whereas, in the inserted state, the peptides are perpendicular to the membrane. Our simulations demonstrate that, for all tested peptides, there is an optimal ratio of hydrophilic/hydrophobic content at which the peptides cross the membrane the easiest. Moreover, we show that the hydrophobicity of peptide termini has an important effect on the translocation barrier. These results provide general guidance to optimize peptides for use as carriers of molecular cargos or as therapeutics themselves.},

In the former, hydrogen bonding of water is hindered yet persists near the solutes. In the latter, hydrogen bonding is depleted, leading to drying of extended apolar surfaces, large forces of attraction, and hysteresis on mesoscopic length scales. The crossover occurs on nanometer length scales, when the local concentration of apolar units is sufficiently high, or when an apolar surface is sufficiently large.

@article{Menshikov2017,
	Abstract = {Hydration forces acting between macroscopic bodies at distances L ≤ 3 nm in pure water are calculated based on the phenomenological model of polar liquids. It is shown that depending on the properties of the bodies, the interacting surfaces polarize the liquid differently, and wetting properties of the surfaces are completely characterized by two parameters. If the surfaces are hydrophilic, liquid molecules are polarized at right angles to the surfaces, and the interaction is the short-range repulsion (the forces of interaction decrease exponentially over the characteristic length $\lambda$ ≈ 0.2 nm). The interaction between the hydrophobic surfaces is more diversified and has been studied less. For L ≤ 3 nm, the interaction exhibits universal properties, while for L ≤ 3 nm, it considerably depends on the properties of the surfaces and on the distances between them, as well as on the composition of the polar liquid. In full agreement with the available experimental results we find that if the interfaces are mostly hydrophobic, then the interaction is attractive and long-range (the interaction forces diminish exponentially with decay length 1.2 nm). In this case, the resultant polarization of water molecules is parallel to the surface. It is shown that hydration forces are determined by nonlinear effects of polarization of the liquid in the bulk or by analogous nonlinearity of the interaction of water with a submerged body. This means that the forces of interaction cannot be calculated correctly in the linear response approximation. The forces acting between hydrophobic or hydrophilic surfaces are of the entropy type or electrostatic, respectively. It is shown that hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces for L ≤ 3 nm repel each other. The calculated intensity of their interaction is in agreement with experimental data. We predict the existence of an intermediate regime in which a body cannot order liquid molecules, which results in a much weaker attraction that decreases in inverse proportion to the squared distance between the surfaces of bodies. The difference between the microscopic structures of liquids confined in nanovolumes from liquids in large volumes is considered. The proposed model is applicable for a quantitative description of the properties of water at temperatures T satisfying the condition 0 < (T--Tc)/Tc≪ 1, where Tc≈ 230 K is the temperature of the ferroelectric phase transition observed in supercooled water. Under standard conditions, the model can be used for obtaining qualitative estimates.},

@article{Eriksson1989,
	Abstract = {Through recent surface force measurements it has been convincingly demonstrated that strong and amazingly long-range, attractive interaction forces act between hydrophobic surfaces immersed in water. Upon separating two such surfaces from molecular contact a vapour/gas cavity normally forms. This is not the case, however, when gradually diminishing the surface separation. The hydrophobic attraction forces have been recorded in this latter, metastable regime. A mean-field theory based on a square-gradient assumption is presented in this paper which is shown to account reasonably well for the surface forces found experimentally for two cylindrically shaped, hydrophobic surfaces interacting in water. The order parameter/variational approach taken is closely related conceptually to earlier theories of repulsive hydration forces by Marcelja et al. and Cevc et al. The present theory implies that rather minor, hydrogen-bond-propagated molecular ordering effects, in the contact layers of water molecules next to the hydrophobic surfaces and in the core of the thin water film, give rise to the attraction observed. However, it does not fully address the intriguing question as to how it comes about that the hydrophobic attraction forces extend over such a wide range as 70-90 nm. It merely points in the direction that surface-induced structural changes in the core of the this water film (so far not captured by molecular dynamics simulations) which demand minimal free-energy expense may generate an interaction of a long-range nature.},

@article{Israelachvili1982,
	Abstract = {The attractive interaction between organic nonpolar molecules, such as hydrocarbons, in water is unusually strong. This 'hydrophobic interaction' 1 is responsible for the very low solubility of hydrophobic molecules in water, and has a central role in micelle formation, biological membrane structure, and in determining the conformations of proteins2,3. It was once believed that because the interaction is so strong there is a 'hydrophobic bond' associated with it2,4; but it is now recognized that the interaction involves the configurational rearrangement of water molecules as two hydrophobic species come together5-9 and is therefore of longer range than a typical covalent bond. However, there has been no experimental information available concerning the distance dependence and effective range of this interaction. From measurements of the total force as a function of distance between two hydrophobic surfaces immersed in aqueous electrolyte solutions we have determined accurately the attractive component due to the hydrophobic interaction and found that the hydrophobic interaction has the same range as, but is about an order of magnitude stronger than, the van der Waals-dispersion force; and that in the range 0-10 nm it decays exponentially with distance with a decay length of ∼1 nm. The results can be roughly extrapolated to molecular interactions and show that the interaction free energy of two hydrophobic solute molecules of radius R (nm) in water at 21 $\,^{\circ}$C is approximately given by $\Delta$GH = -40R kJ mol-1, which is in agreement with previous estimates. However, the hydrophobic interaction is not due to a 'hydrophobic bond', and its long-range nature has obvious implications for the mechanism and rates of folding as well as the equilibrium conformations of proteins and other macromolecules. {\textcopyright} 1982 Nature Publishing Group.},

@misc{Christenson2001,
	Abstract = {Direct measurements of the force between hydrophobic surfaces across aqueous solutions are reviewed. The results are presented according to the method of preparation of the hydrophobic surfaces. No single model appears to fit all published results, and an attempt is made to classify the measured interactions in three different categories. The large variation of the measured interaction, often within each class, depending on the type of hydrophobic surface is emphasized. (I) Stable hydrophobic surfaces show only a comparatively short-range interaction, although little quantitative data on this attraction have been published. (II) Many results showing very long-range attractive forces are most likely due to the presence of sub-microscopic bubbles on the hydrophobic surfaces. Such an interaction is typically measured between silica surfaces made hydrophobic by silylation. Between self-assembled thiol layers on gold surfaces very short-range attractive forces are possibly due to the presence or nucleation of bubbles. The reason for the apparent stability of these bubbles is not clear and warrants further investigation. (III) Results obtained with LB films of surfactants or lipids on mica appear to give rise to a different type of force that fits neither of these two categories. This force is an exponentially decaying attraction, often of considerable range. The force turns more attractive at smaller separations, and may at short range be similar to the interaction measured between stable hydrophobic surfaces. An apparently similar, exponential attraction is also found between mica surfaces bearing surfactants adsorbed from cyclohexane, between silylated, plasma-treated mica surfaces and between both mica and silica surfaces with surfactants adsorbed in situ. This type of force also occurs between some surfaces of relatively low hydrophobicity as well as between one such hydrophobic surface and a hydrophilic surface. No convincing model can explain this third type of interaction for all systems in which it has been observed. This review of work to date points to the importance of the morphology and structure of the hydrophobic surface, and how it may change during the interaction of two surfaces. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

	Abstract = {We present here a brief review of direct force measurements between hydrophobic surfaces in aqueous solutions. For almost 70 years, researchers have attempted to understand the hydrophobic effect (the low solubility of hydrophobic solutes in water) and the hydrophobic interaction or force (the unusually strong attraction of hydrophobic surfaces and groups in water). After many years of research into how hydrophobic interactions affect the thermodynamic properties of processes such as micelle formation (self-assembly) and protein folding, the results of direct force measurements between macroscopic surfaces began to appear in the 1980s. Reported ranges of the attraction between variously prepared hydrophobic surfaces in water grew from the initially reported value of 80-100 {\AA} to values as large as 3,000 {\AA}. Recent improved surface preparation techniques and the combination of surface force apparatus measurements with atomic force microscopy imaging have made it possible to explain the long-range part of this interaction (at separations {\textgreater}200 {\AA}) that is observed between certain surfaces. We tentatively conclude that only the short-range part of the attraction ({\textless}100 {\AA}) represents the true hydrophobic interaction, although a quantitative explanation for this interaction will require additional research. Although our force-measuring technique did not allow collection of reliable data at separations {\textless}10 {\AA}, it is clear that some stronger force must act in this regime if the measured interaction energy curve is to extrapolate to the measured adhesion energy as the surface separation approaches zero (i.e., as the surfaces come into molecular contact). {\textcopyright} 2006 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

@article{Hammer2010,
	Abstract = {After nearly 30 years of research on the hydrophobic interaction, the search for the hydrophobic force law is still continuing. Indeed, there are more questions than answers, and the experimental data are often quite different for nominally similar conditions, as well as, apparently, for nano-, micro-, and macroscopic surfaces. This has led to the conclusion that the experimentally observed force-distance relationships are either a combination of different 'fundamental' interactions, or that the hydrophobic force-law, if there is one, is complex - depending on numerous parameters. The only unexpectedly strong attractive force measured in all experiments so far has a range of D ≈ 100-200 {\AA}, increasing roughly exponentially down to ∼10-20 {\AA} and then more steeply down to adhesive contact at D = 0 or, for power-law potentials, effectively at D ≈ 2 {\AA}. The measured forces in this regime (100-200 {\AA}) and especially the adhesive forces are much stronger, and have a different distance-dependence from the continuum VDW force (Lifshitz theory) for non-conducting dielectric media. We suggest a three-regime force-law for the forces observed between hydrophobic surfaces: In the first, from 100-200 {\AA} to thousands of {\aa}ngstroms, the dominating force is created by complementary electrostatic domains or patches on the apposing surfaces and/or bridging vapour cavities; a 'pure' but still not well-understood 'long-range hydrophobic force' dominates the second regime from ∼150 to ∼15 {\AA}, possibly due to an enhanced Hamaker constant associated with the 'proton-hopping' polarizability of water; while below ∼10-15 {\AA} to contact there is another 'pure short-range hydrophobic force' related to water structuring effects associated with surface-induced changes in the orientation and/or density of water molecules and H-bonds at the water-hydrophobic interface. We present recent SFA and other experimental results, as well as a simplified model for water based on a spherically-symmetric potential that is able to capture some basic features of hydrophobic association. Such a model may be useful for theoretical studies of the HI over the broad range of scales observed in SFA experiments. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

	Abstract = {The solvation force between neutral surfaces in water is studied by running the grand canonical ensemble Monte Carlo simulations on the system containing up to 102 water-like particles between parallel smooth plates immersed in the fluid. The water molecules are modeled like hard spheres with embedded point dipoles and orientation dependent adhesion potential. The pressure between the walls as a function of the distance displays oscillations resembling those observed experimentally, The overall attraction between the plates is observed despite the absence of direct wall-wall or wall-fluid attractive forces. {\textcopyright} 1987 American Institute of Physics.},

	Abstract = {The Hydrophobic interaction between two methane molecules in salt-free and high salt-containing aqueous solutions and the structure in such solutions have been investigated using an atomistic model solved by Monte Carlo simulations. Monovalent salt representing NaCl and divalent salt with the same nonelectrostatic properties as the monovalent salt have been used to examine the influence of the valence of the salt species. In salt-free solution the effective interaction between the two methane molecules displayed a global minimum at close contact of the two methane molecules and a solvent-separated secondary minimum. In 3 and 5 M monovalent salt solution the potential of mean force became slightly more attractive, and in a 3 M divalent salt solution the attraction became considerably stronger. The structure of the aqueous solutions was determined by radial distribution functions and angular probability functions. The distortion of the native water structure increased with ion valence. The increase of the hydrophobic attraction was associated with (i) a breakdown of the tetrahedral structure formed by neighboring water molecules and of the hydrogen bonds between them and (i) the concomitant increase of the solution density. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Chemical Society.},

@article{Israelachvili1984,
	Abstract = {The attractive force-law between two hydrophobic (hydrocarbon) surfaces in aqueous solutions has been derived from total force measurements on monolayer coated mica surfaces. This "hydrophobic interaction" is much stronger than the expected van der Waals interaction at distances below 8 nm and decays exponentially with distance. The results highlight the long-range nature of hydrophobic (solvation) forces and indicate that these forces may determine the magnitude of the energy barriers between interacting charged particles and hence the stability of hydrophobic colloids. The results are also consistent with previous experimental and theoretical estimates of the hydrophobic interaction between contacting nonpolar solute molecules in water. {\textcopyright} 1984.},

@article{Marcelja1977,
	Abstract = {A simple theory of aqueous non-electrolyte solutions is developed to describe the effect of solvent correlation on solute-solute interactions. It is formulated in terms of a Landau expansion of the free energy density, obtained from the Ornstein-Zernike relations, and given specific motivation through a generalised Pople model for water structure. A functional form of the solute-solute interaction of both hydrophobic and polar solutes in aqueous solutions is investigated. The theory accounts for the experimentally observed solute-solute attraction and gives a more precise meaning to empirical solute-solute potentials.},
