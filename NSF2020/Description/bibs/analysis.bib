@article{Grinfeld2010,
	Abstract = {Our goal is to explore boundary variations of spectral problems from the calculus of moving surfaces point of view. Hadamard's famous formula for simple Laplace eigenvalues under Dirichlet boundary conditions is generalized in a number of significant ways, including Neumann and mixed boundary conditions, multiple eigenvalues, and second order variations. Some of these formulas appear for the first time here. Furthermore, we present an analytical framework for deriving general formulas of the Hadamard type. The presented analysis finds direct applications in shape optimization and other variational problems. As a specific application, we discuss equilibrium and stable shapes of electron bubbles. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

@article{Bandle2015,
	Abstract = {In this paper, the first and second domain variations for functionals related to elliptic boundary and eigenvalue problems with Robin boundary conditions are computed. Extremal properties of the ball among nearly spherical domains of given volume are derived. The discussion leads to a Steklov eigenvalue problem. As a by-product, a general characterization of the optimal shapes is obtained.},

@article{Lee2018,
	Abstract = {This article addresses the boundary asymptotics of the electrostatic potential in non-neutral electrochemistry models with small Debye length in bounded domains. Under standard physical assumptions motivated by non-electroneutral phenomena in oxidation--reduction reactions, we show that the electrostatic potential asymptotically blows up at boundary points with respect to the bulk reference potential as the scaled Debye length tends to zero. The analysis gives a lower bound for the blow-up rate with respect to the model parameters. Moreover, the maximum potential difference over any compact subset of the physical domain vanishes exponentially in the zero-Debye-length limit. The results mathematically confirm the physical description that electrolyte solutions are electrically neutral in the bulk and are strongly electrically non-neutral near charged surfaces.},

We first establish a lemma of lower-upper solutions by using the Schauder fixed point theorem. By the method of boundary functions and the lemma of lower-upper solutions we obtain the existence, asymptotic estimates, and uniqueness of the solution with boundary and interior layers for the proposed problem.},
