	Abstract = {Recently, the role of force in cellular processes has become more evident, and now with advances in force spectroscopy, the response of proteins to force can be directly studied. Such studies have found that native proteins are brittle, and thus not very deformable. Here, we examine the mechanical properties of a class of intermediates referred to as the molten globule state. Using optical trap force spectroscopy, we investigated the response to force of the native and molten globule states of apomyoglobin along different pulling axes. Unlike natively folded proteins, the molten globule state of apomyoglobin is compliant (large distance to the transition state); this large compliance means that the molten globule is more deformable and the unfolding rate is more sensitive to force (the application of force or tension will have a more dramatic effect on the unfolding rate). Our studies suggest that these are general properties of molten globules and could have important implications for mechanical processes in the cell.},

	Abstract = {The design of complex self-assembled structures remains a challenging task due to the intricate relationship between the properties of the building blocks and the final morphology of the aggregates. Here, we report such a relationship for rod-like particles with one or two attractive patches based on a combination of computer simulations and analytical theory. We investigated the formation of finite aggregates under various conditions and constructed structure diagrams, which can be used to determine and extrapolate the system composition. The size of the clusters is mainly determined by the size of the attractive patches and their geometrical arrangement. We showed that it is challenging to obtain clusters with more than four particles in high yields, and more complex building blocks or additional molecules would need to be used. Moreover, the particles with patch sizes close to the structure boundaries can switch between the aggregate state by a small change in conditions. These findings can be useful for the development of self-assembling building blocks and for the understanding of protein folds of coiled coils under various conditions.},

	Abstract = {Using dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulations, we model the interaction between nanoscopic lipid vesicles and Janus nanoparticles in the presence of an imposed flow. Both the vesicle and Janus nanoparticles are localized on a hydrophilic substrate and immersed in a hydrophilic solution. The fluid-driven vesicle successfully picks up Janus particles on the substrate and transports these particles as cargo along the surface. The vesicle can carry up to four particles as its payload. Hence, the vesicles can act as nanoscopic "vacuum cleaners", collecting nanoscopic debris localized on the floors of the fluidic devices. Importantly, these studies reveal how an imposed flow can facilitate the incorporation of nanoparticles into nanoscale vesicles. With the introduction of a "sticky" domain on the substrate, the vesicles can also robustly drop off and deposit the particles on the surface. The controlled pickup and delivery of nanoparticles via lipid vesicles can play an important step in the bottom-up assembly of these nanoparticles within small-scale fluidic devices. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

	Abstract = {Viruses, the molecular nanomachines infecting hosts ranging from prokaryotes to eukaryotes, come in different sizes, shapes, and symmetries. Questions such as what principles govern their structural organization, what factors guide their assembly, how these viruses integrate multifarious functions into one unique structure have enamored researchers for years. In the last five decades, following Caspar and Klug's elegant conceptualization of how viruses are constructed, high-resolution structural studies using X-ray crystallography and more recently cryo-EM techniques have provided a wealth of information on structures of a variety of viruses. These studies have significantly -furthered our understanding of the principles that underlie structural organization in viruses. Such an understanding has practical impact in providing a rational basis for the design and development of antiviral strategies. In this chapter, we review principles underlying capsid formation in a variety of viruses, emphasizing the recent developments along with some historical perspective. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

Using an origami-like technique, planar silicon nitride structures of various geometries are folded to produce three-dimensional objects of 50-100 $\mu$m. Capillarity is a particularly effective mechanism since surface tension forces dominate over bulk forces at small scales. The spontaneous evaporation of water forms the driving mechanism for this microfabrication technique. Therefore the actuating liquid disappears in the final structure. A model describing the elastocapillary interaction of the folding process is compared with experiments. By tailoring the elastic and capillary properties a variety of three-dimensional micro-objects can be realized. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Institute of Physics.},

	Abstract = {Small-scale optical and mechanical components and machines require control over three-dimensional structure at the microscale. Inspired by the analogy between paper and two-dimensional materials, origami-style folding of atomically thin materials offers a promising approach for making microscale structures from the thinnest possible sheets. In this Letter, we show that a monolayer of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) can be folded into three-dimensional shapes by a technique called capillary origami, in which the surface tension of a droplet drives the folding of a thin sheet. We define shape nets by patterning rigid metal panels connected by MoS2 hinges, allowing us to fold micron-scale polyhedrons. Finally, we demonstrate that these shapes can be folded in parallel without the use of micropipettes or microfluidics by means of a microemulsion of droplets that dissolves into the bulk solution to drive folding. These results demonstrate controllable folding of the thinnest possible materials using capillary orig...},

	Abstract = {Active materials represent a new class of condensed matter in which motile elements may collectively form dynamic, global structures out of equilibrium. Here, we present a general strategy to reconfigure active particles into various collective states by introducing imbalanced interactions. We demonstrate the concept with computer simulations of self-propelled colloidal spheres, and experimentally validate it in a two-dimensional (2D) system of metal-dielectric Janus colloids subjected to perpendicular a.c. electric fields. The mismatched, frequency-dependent dielectric responses of the two hemispheres of the colloids allow simultaneous control of particle motility and colloidal interactions. We realized swarms, chains, clusters and isotropic gases from the same precursor particle by changing the electric-field frequency. Large-scale polar waves, vortices and jammed domains are also observed, with the persistent time-dependent evolution of their collective structure evoking that of classical materials. This strategy of asymmetry-driven active self-organization should generalize rationally to other active 2D and three-dimensional (3D) materials.},

@article{Sharifi-Mood2015,
	Abstract = {We address the question: how does capillarity propel microspheres along curvature gradients? For a particle on a fluid interface, there are two conditions that can apply at the three phase contact line: either the contact line adopts an equilibrium contact angle, or it can be pinned by kinetic trapping, e.g. at chemical heterogeneities, asperities, or other pinning sites on the particle surface. We formulate the curvature capillary energy for both scenarios for particles smaller than the capillary length and far from any pinning boundaries. The scale and range of the distortion made by the particle are set by the particle radius; we use singular perturbation methods to find the distortions and to rigorously evaluate the associated capillary energies. For particles with equilibrium contact angles, contrary to the literature, we find that the capillary energy is negligible, with the first contribution bounded to fourth order in the product of the particle radius and the deviatoric curvature of the host interface. For pinned contact lines, we find curvature capillary energies that are finite, with a functional form investigated previously by us for disks and microcylinders on curved interfaces. In experiments, we show microspheres migrate along deterministic trajectories toward regions of maximum deviatoric curvature with curvature capillary energies ranging from 6 × 103-5 × 104kBT. These data agree with the curvature capillary energy for the case of pinned contact lines. The underlying physics of this migration is a coupling of the interface deviatoric curvature with the quadrupolar mode of nanometric disturbances in the interface owing to the particle's contact line undulations. This work is an example of the major implications of nanometric roughness and contact line pinning for colloidal dynamics.},

	Abstract = {For partially wetting, ellipsoidal colloids trapped at a fluid interface, their effective, interface-mediated interactions of capillary and fluctuation-induced type are analyzed. For contact angles different from 90 $\,^{\circ}$ , static interface deformations arise which lead to anisotropic capillary forces that are substantial already for micrometer-sized particles. The capillary problem is solved using an efficient perturbative treatment which allows a fast determination of the capillary interaction for all distances between and orientations of two particles. Besides static capillary forces, fluctuation-induced forces caused by thermally excited capillary waves arise at fluid interfaces. For the specific choice of a spatially fixed three-phase contact line, the asymptotic behavior of the fluctuation-induced force is determined analytically for both the close-distance and the long-distance regime and compared to numerical solutions. {\textcopyright} 2008 EDP Sciences, Societ{\`{a}} Italiana di Fisica and Springer-Verlag.},

	Abstract = {Janus particles are colloids that have both hydrophilic and hydrophobic faces. Recent advances in particle synthesis enable the generation of geometrically and chemically anisotropic Janus particles with high uniformity and precision. These amphiphilic particles are similar to molecular surfactants in many aspects; they self-assemble in bulk media and also readily attach to fluid interfaces. These particles, just like molecular surfactants, could potentially function as effective stabilizers for various multiphasic systems such as emulsions and foams. In particular, just as the shape and chemical composition have a significant impact on the surfactancy of molecular amphiphiles, the ability to control the shape and wetting properties of Janus particles could provide a unique opportunity to control their surface activity. In this review, we first examine the recent developments in using amphiphilic Janus particles as colloid surfactants to stabilize multiphasic mixtures such as emulsions. These results have motivated a number of detailed investigations aimed at understanding the behaviour of Janus particles at fluid-fluid interfaces at the microscopic level, which we highlight. This review also discusses the importance of controlling the shape of Janus particles, which has a drastic impact on their behaviour at fluid interfaces. We conclude this review by presenting outlook on the future directions and outstanding problems that warrant further study to fully enable the utilization of Janus particles as colloid surfactants in practical applications. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

	Abstract = {Anisotropic microparticles adsorbed at fluid-fluid interfaces create interface deformations and interact because of capillarity. Thus far, much of the work related to this phenomenon has focused on capillary attraction, which is ubiquitous in the far field for microparticles at interfaces. In this paper, we explore capillary repulsion. We study particles at interfaces with contact line undulations having wavelength significantly smaller than the characteristic particle size. By a combination of simulation and experiment, we show that identical microparticles with features in phase attract each other, and microparticles with different wavelengths, under certain conditions, repel each other in the near field, leading to a measurable equilibrium separation. We study these assemblies at air-water and oil-water interfaces. The capillary bond between particles at air-water interfaces is rigid, whereas at oil-water interfaces, the bond between particles with near field repulsion is elastic under perturbation. These results have implications for the capillary assembly of rough microparticles at interfaces, and for the tailoring of mechanics of particle monolayers. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

Weshow this in experiments in which the shape of the interface is molded by pinning to vertical pillars of different cross-sections. These interfaces present well-defined curvature fields that orient and steer particles along complex trajectories. Trajectories and orientations are predicted by a theoretical model in which capillary forces and torques are related to Gaussian curvature gradients and angular deviations from principal directions of curvature. Interface curvature diverges near sharp boundaries, similar to an electric field near a pointed conductor.We exploit this feature to induce migration and assembly at preferred locations, and to create complex structures. We also report a repulsive interaction, in which microparticles move away from planar bounding walls along curvature gradient contours. These phenomena should be widely useful in the directed assembly of micro- and nanoparticles with potential application in the fabrication of materials with tunable mechanical or electronic properties, in emulsion production, and in encapsulation.},

However, most naturally occurring wrinkles do not satisfy these stipulations. Here we present a scheme that quantitatively explains the wrinkle wavelength beyond such idealized situations. We propose a local law that incorporates both mechanical and geometrical effects on the spatial variation of wrinkle wavelength. Our experiments on thin polymer films provide strong evidence for its validity.

Self-assembly, and the related method of self-folding of planar patterned membranes, provide a promising means to solve this problem. Here, we investigate self-assembly processes driven by wetting interactions to shape the contour of a functional, nonplanar photovoltaic (PV) device. A mechanics model based on the theory of thin plates is developed to identify the critical conditions for self-folding of different 2D geometrical shapes. This strategy is demonstrated for specifically designed millimeter-scale silicon objects, which are self-assembled into spherical, and other 3D shapes and integrated into fully functional light-trapping PV devices. The resulting 3D devices offer a promising way to efficiently harvest solar energy in thin cells using concentrator microarrays that function without active light tracking systems.},

	Abstract = {Assembly permits the integration of different materials and manufacturing processes to increase system functionality. It is an essential step in the fabrication of useful systems across size scales from buildings to molecules. However, at the microscale, traditional "grasp and release" assembly methods and chemically inspired self-assembly processes are less effective due to scaling effects. Many methods have been developed for improving microscale assembly. Often these methods include fluidic forces or the use a fluidic medium in order to enhance their performance. This paper reviews basic assembly theory and modeling methods. Three basic assembly strategies (tool-directed, process-directed, and part-directed) are proposed for categorizing these methods. It then summarizes progress in using fluidic forces (surface tension, viscous) and external fields (magnetic, electric, light) to aid microscale assembly. Applications of recent advances in both continuous flow and digital microfluidics in microscale assembly are also addressed. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

The process has been demonstrated with metallic, semiconducting and polymeric films and has been used to curve tubes with diameters as small as 2. nm and fold polyhedra as small as 100. nm, with a surface patterning resolution of 15. nm. Self-folding methods are important for drug delivery applications since they provide a means to realize 3D, biocompatible, all-polymeric containers with well-tailored composition, size, shape, wall thickness, porosity, surface patterns and chemistry. Self-folding is also a highly parallel process, and it is possible to encapsulate or self-load therapeutic cargo during assembly. A variety of therapeutic cargos such as small molecules, peptides, proteins, bacteria, fungi and mammalian cells have been encapsulated in self-folded polymeric containers. In this review, we focus on self-folding of all-polymeric containers. We discuss the mechanistic aspects of self-folding of polymeric containers driven by differential stresses or surface tension forces, the applications of self-folding polymers in drug delivery and we outline future challenges. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

The driving force of vesicle budding stems from the preference of proteins to gather in regions of high curvature. A sufficiently high concentration of proteins therefore can influence the topology of the membrane.

	Abstract = {Conical inclusions in a lipid bilayer generate an overall spontaneous curvature of the membrane that depends on concentration and geometry of the inclusions. Examples are integral and attached membrane proteins, viruses, and lipid domains. We propose an analytical model to study budding and vesiculation of the lipid bilayer membrane, which is based on the membrane bending energy and the translational entropy of the inclusions. If the inclusions are placed on a membrane with similar curvature radius, their repulsive membrane-mediated interaction is screened. Therefore, for high inclusion density the inclusions aggregate, induce bud formation, and finally vesiculation. Already with the bending energy alone our model allows the prediction of bud radii. However, in case the inclusions induce a single large vesicle to split into two smaller vesicles, bending energy alone predicts that the smaller vesicles have different sizes whereas the translational entropy favors the formation of equal-sized vesicles. Our results agree well with those of recent computer simulations. {\textcopyright} 2009 The American Physical Society.},

	Abstract = {Biological membranes and lipid vesicles often display complex shapes with non-uniform membrane curvature. When adhesive nanoparticles with chemically uniform surfaces come into contact with such membranes, they exhibit four different engulfment regimes as recently shown by a systematic stability analysis. Depending on the local curvature of the membrane, the particles either remain free, become partially or completely engulfed by the membrane, or display bistability between free and completely engulfed states. Here, we go beyond stability analysis and develop an analytical theory to leading order in the ratio of particle-to-vesicle size. This theory allows us to determine the local and global energy landscapes of uniform nanoparticles that are attracted towards membranes and vesicles. While the local energy landscape depends only on the local curvature of the vesicle membrane and not on the overall membrane shape, the global energy landscape describes the variation of the equilibrium state of the particle as it probes different points along the membrane surface. In particular, we find that the binding energy of a partially engulfed particle depends on the `unperturbed' local curvature of the membrane in the absence of the particle. This curvature dependence leads to local forces that pull the partially engulfed particles towards membrane segments with lower and higher mean curvature if the particles originate from the exterior and interior solution, respectively, corresponding to endo- and exocytosis. Thus, for partial engulfment, endocytic particles undergo biased diffusion towards the membrane segments with the lowest membrane curvature, whereas exocytic particles move towards segments with the highest curvature. The curvature-induced forces are also effective for Janus particles with one adhesive and one non-adhesive surface domain. In fact, Janus particles with a strongly adhesive surface domain are always partially engulfed which implies that they provide convenient probes for experimental studies of the curvature-induced forces that arise for complex-shaped membranes.},

The optimal nets are the ones that maximize the number of vertex connections, i.e., vertices that have only two of its faces cut away from each other in the net. Previous methods for finding such nets are based on random search, and thus, they do not guarantee the optimal solution. Here, we propose a deterministic procedure. We map the connectivity of the shell into a shell graph, where the nodes and links of the graph represent the vertices and edges of the shell, respectively. Identifying the nets that maximize the number of vertex connections corresponds to finding the set of maximum leaf spanning trees of the shell graph. This method allows us not only to design the self-assembly of much larger shell structures but also to apply additional design criteria, as a complete catalog of the maximum leaf spanning trees is obtained.},

Our main findings are that (i) compactness is a simple and effective design principle for maximizing the yield of self-folding polyhedra; and (ii) shortest paths from 2D nets to 3D polyhedra in the configuration space are important for rationalizing experimentally observed folding pathways. Our work provides a model problem amenable to experimental and theoretical analysis of design principles and pathways in self-assembly.},

	Abstract = {We develop theory to explore the relationship between the amino acid sequence of a protein and its native structure. A protein is modeled as a specific sequence of H (nonpolar) and P (polar) residues, subject to excluded volume and an HH attraction free energy $\epsilon$. Exhaustive exploration of the full conformational space is computationally possible because molecules are modeled as short chains on a 2D square lattice. We use this model to test approximations in a recent mean-field theory of protein stability. Also, exhaustive exploration permits us to identify the ``native'' state(s) in the model, the conformation(s) of global free energy minimum. We then explore the relationship between sequences and native structures by (i) further exhaustive exploration of the full space of all sequences, for short chains, and (ii) random selection of sequences, for longer chains, in some cases exploring exhaustively only the fully compact conformations. The model has the following properties. For small $\epsilon$, the chains are unfolded. With increasing HH attraction, molecules with certain sequences fold to a state with relatively few conformations that have (i) low free energy, (ii) high compactness, (iii) a core of H residues, and (iv) substantial secondary structure. The potential of a molecule to fold to this state is predicted largely by the composition, but for intermediate compositions it depends also on the specific sequence of residues. Some folding sequences have multiple native states; those native structures are broadly distributed throughout the conformational space. However, a most interesting prediction is that, even with only the H and P discrimination among residues in this model, a folding sequence is most likely to have only a single native conformation, a predominance that increases with chain length. {\textcopyright} 1989, American Chemical Society.

	Abstract = {Systems with interfaces are abundant in both technological applications and biology. While a fluid interface separates two fluids, membranes separate the inside of vesicles from the outside, the interior of biological cells from the environment, and compartmentalize cells into organelles. The physical properties of interfaces are characterized by interface tension, those of membranes are characterized by bending and stretching elasticity. Amphiphilic molecules like surfactants that are added to a system with two immiscible fluids decrease the interface tension and induce a bending rigidity. Lipid bilayer membranes of vesicles can be stretched or compressed by osmotic pressure; in biological cells, also the presence of a cytoskeleton can induce membrane tension. If the thickness of the interface or the membrane is small compared with its lateral extension, both can be described using two-dimensional mathematical surfaces embedded in three-dimensional space. We review recent work on the interaction of particles with interfaces and membranes. This can be micrometer-sized particles at interfaces that stabilise emulsions or form colloidosomes, as well as typically nanometer-sized particles at membranes, such as viruses, parasites, and engineered drug delivery systems. In both cases, we first discuss the interaction of single particles with interfaces and membranes, e.g. particles in external fields, non-spherical particles, and particles at curved interfaces, followed by interface-mediated interaction between two particles, many-particle interactions, interface and membrane curvature-induced phenomena, and applications.},

	Abstract = {Although negligible at large scales, capillary forces may become dominant for submillimetric objects. Surface tension is usually associated with the spherical shape of small droplets and bubbles, wetting phenomena, imbibition, or the motion of insects at the surface of water. However, beyond liquid interfaces, capillary forces can also deform solid bodies in their bulk, as observed in recent experiments with very soft gels. Capillary interactions, which are responsible for the cohesion of sandcastles, can also bend slender structures and induce the bundling of arrays of fibers. Thin sheets can spontaneously wrap liquid droplets within the limit of the constraints dictated by differential geometry. This review aims to describe the different scaling parameters and characteristic lengths involved in elastocapillarity. We focus on three main configurations, each characterized by a specific dimension: three-dimensional (3D), deformations induced in bulk solids; 1D, bending and bundling of rod-like structures; and 2D, bending and stretching of thin sheets. Although each configuration deserves a detailed review, we hope our broad description provides a general view of elastocapillarity.},

Like traditional colloids, they are large enough to be observed under optical microscopy in real time and small enough to diffuse by Brownian motion, but their interesting and useful new properties of directional interaction bring new research opportunities to the fields of soft matter and fundamental materials research as well as to applications in other disciplines and in technologies such as electronic paper and other multiphase engineering. In this review, a variety of methods that have been used to synthesize Janus particles are introduced. Following this, we summarize the use of Janus particles as basic units that assemble into novel structures and tune important material properties. The concluding sections highlight some of the technological applications, including recent progress in using Janus particles as microprobes, micromotors, electronic paper, and solid surfactants.},

	Abstract = {The effect of using a viscoelastic suspending medium on the in-plane hydrodynamic interaction between two equally sized spheres in shear flow is studied experimentally to understand flow-induced assembly behavior (i.e., string formation). A counterrotating device equipped with a Couette geometry is used together with quantitative videomicroscopy. To evaluate the effects of differences in rheological properties of the suspending media, fluids have been selected that highlight specific constitutive features. These include a reference Newtonian fluid (N), a constant-viscosity, high-elasticity Boger fluid (BF), a wormlike micellar surfactant solution with a single dominant relaxation time (WMS), and a broad spectrum shear-thinning elastic polymer solution (ST). As expected, the trajectories are symmetric in the Newtonian fluid. In the BF, the midpoints of the spheres are observed to remain in the same plane before and after the interaction, as in the Newtonian fluid, although the path lines are in this case no longer symmetric. Interactions in the ST and WMS are highly asymmetric. Two fundamentally different kinds of path lines are observed in the WMS and ST: reversing and open trajectories. The type of trajectory depends on the initial configuration of the spheres with respect to each other and on the shear rate. On the basis of the obtained results, shear-thinning of the viscosity seems to be the key rheological parameter that determines the overall nature of the interactions, rather than the relative magnitude of the normal stress differences. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

Extending recent research on Janus particles and completing the study of Janus spheroids, we conduct a systematic investigation on the self-assembly of Janus prolate spheroids based on a primitive model that we proposed. Janus prolate spheroids are particles that have a prolate spheroidal body and two hemi-surfaces along the major axis coded with different chemical properties. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we investigate the effects of the aspect ratio on the self-assembly process. In contrast to the vesicle-like aggregates for Janus oblate spheroids, we obtain various ordered cluster structures for Janus prolate spheroids through self-assembly. With an increasing aspect ratio, we find a transition of cluster morphology, from vesicles to tubular micelles and micelles. In particular, a relatively small change in the aspect ratio leads to a rather significant change in morphology. We apply a cluster analysis to understand the mechanism associated with such a transition. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the self-assembly of amphiphilic nanoparticles (NPs) functionalized with mixed monolayers of hydrophobic and hydrophilic ligands in water. Unlike typical amphiphilic particles with "fixed" surface chemistries, the ligands used here are not bound irreversibly but can rearrange dynamically on the particles surface during their assembly from solution. Depending on the assembly conditions, these adaptive amphiphiles form compact micellar clusters or extended chain-like assemblies in aqueous solution. By controlling the amount of hydrophobic ligands on the particles surface, the average number of nearest neighbors-that is, the preferred coordination number-can be varied systematically from ∼1 (dimers) to ∼2 (linear chains) to ∼3 (extended clusters). To explain these experimental findings, we present an assembly mechanism in which hydrophobic ligands organize dynamically to form discrete patches between proximal NPs to minimize contact with their aqueous surroundings. Monte Carlo simulations incorporating these adaptive hydrophobic interactions reproduce the three-dimensional assemblies observed in experiment. These results suggest a general strategy based on reconfigurable "sticky" patches that may allow for tunable control over particle coordination number within self-assembled structures.},

	Abstract = {We describe the spontaneous incorporation of amphiphilic gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) into the walls of surfactant vesicles. Au NPs were functionalized with mixed monolayers of hydrophilic (deprotonated mercaptoundecanoic acid, MUA) and hydrophobic (octadecanethiol, ODT) ligands, which are known to redistribute dynamically on the NP surface in response to changes in the local environment. When Au NPs are mixed with preformed surfactant vesicles, the hydrophobic ODT ligands on the NP surface interact favorably with the hydrophobic core of the bilayer structure and guide the incorporation of NPs into the vesicle walls. Unlike previous strategies based on small hydrophobic NPs, the present approach allows for the incorporation of water-soluble particles even when the size of the particles greatly exceeds the bilayer thickness. The strategy described here based on inorganic NPs functionalized with two labile ligands should in principle be applicable to other nanoparticle materials and bilayer structures. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},
