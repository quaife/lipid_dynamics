abstract  ="We experimentally investigate the effect of lipid charge on the stiffness of bilayer membranes. The bending rigidity of membranes with composition 0–100 mol% of charged lipids{,} in the absence and presence of salt at different concentrations{,} is measured with the flicker spectroscopy method{,} using the shape fluctuations of giant unilamellar vesicles. The analysis considers both the mean squared amplitudes and the time autocorrelations of the shape modes. Our results show that membrane charge increases the bending rigidity relative to the charge-free membrane. The effect is diminished by the addition of monovalent salt to the suspending solutions. The trend shown by the membrane bending rigidity correlates with zeta potential measurements{,} confirming charge screening at different salt concentrations. The experimental results in the presence of salt are in good agreement with existing theories of membrane stiffening by surface charge."

The equilibrium distance between the tips of the two nipples is determined by a balance of physical forces: repulsion caused by hydration and attraction generated by fusion proteins. The energy to create the initial stalk, caused by bending of cis monolayer leaflets, is much less when the stalk forms between nipples rather than parallel flat membranes. The stalk cannot, however, expand by bending deformations alone, because this would necessitate the creation of a hydrophobic void of prohibitively high energy. But small movements of the lipids out of the plane of their monolayers allow transformation of the stalk into a modified stalk. This intermediate, not previously considered, is a low-energy structure that can reconfigure into a fusion pore via an additional intermediate, the prepore. The lipids of this latter structure are oriented as in a fusion pore, but the bilayer is locally compressed. All membrane rearrangements occur in a discrete local region without creation of an extended hemifusion diaphragm. Importantly, all steps of the proposed pathway are energetically feasible.},

Journal = {Scientific Reports},
Volume = {10},
Issue = {4087},
Abstract = {Liquid-ordered lipid domains represent a lateral inhomogeneity in cellular membranes. These domains have elastic and physicochemical properties different from those of the surrounding membrane. In particular, their thickness exceeds that of the disordered membrane. Thus, elastic deformations arise at the domain boundary in order to compensate for the thickness mismatch. In equilibrium, the deformations lead to an incomplete register of monolayer ordered domains: the elastic energy is minimal if domains in opposing monolayers lie on the top of each other, and their boundaries are laterally shifted by about 3 nm. This configuration introduces a region, composed of one ordered and one disordered monolayers, with an intermediate bilayer thickness. Besides, a jump in a local monolayer curvature takes place in this intermediate region, concentrating here most of the elastic stress. This region can participate in a lateral sorting of membrane inclusions by offering them an optimal bilayer thickness and local curvature conditions. In the present study, we consider the sorting of deformable lipid inclusions, undeformable peripheral and deeply incorporated peptide inclusions, and undeformable transmembrane inclusions of different molecular geometry. With rare exceptions, all types of inclusions have an affinity to the ordered domain boundary as compared to the bulk phases. The optimal lateral distribution of inclusions allows relaxing the elastic stress at the boundary of domains.},

abstract = "Biological membranes deform in response to resident proteins leading to a coupling between membrane shape and protein localization. Additionally, the membrane influences the function of membrane proteins. Here we review contributions to this field from continuum elastic membrane models focusing on the class of models that couple the protein to the membrane. While it has been argued that continuum models cannot reproduce the distortions observed in fully-atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, we suggest that this failure can be overcome by using chemically accurate representations of the protein. We outline our recent advances along these lines with our hybrid continuum-atomistic model, and we show the model is in excellent agreement with fully-atomistic simulations of the nhTMEM16 lipid scramblase. We believe that the speed and accuracy of continuum-atomistic methodologies will make it possible to simulate large scale, slow biological processes, such as membrane morphological changes, that are currently beyond the scope of other computational approaches.

abstract  ="The theory of elasticity of lipid membranes is used widely to describe processes of cell membrane remodeling. Classically{,} the functional of a membrane{'}s elastic energy is derived under assumption of small deformations; the membrane is considered as an infinitely thin film. This functional is quadratic on membrane surface curvature{,} with half of the splay modulus as its proportionality coefficient; it is generally applicable for small deformations only. Any validity of this functional for the regime of strong deformations should be verified experimentally. Recently{,} research using molecular dynamics simulations challenged the validity of this classic{,} linear model{,} i.e. the constancy of the splay modulus for strongly bent membranes. Here we demonstrate that the quadratic energy functional still can be applied for calculation of the elastic energy of strongly deformed membranes without introducing higher order terms with additional elastic moduli{,} but only if applied separately for each lipid monolayer. For cylindrical membranes{,} both classic and monolayerwise models yield equally accurate results. For cylindrical deformations we experimentally show that the elastic energy of lipid monolayers is additive: a low molecular weight solvent leads to an approximately twofold decrease in the membrane bending stiffness. Accumulation of solvent molecules in the inner monolayer of a membrane cylinder can explain these results{,} as the solvent partially prevents lipid molecules from splaying there. Thus{,} the linear theory of elasticity can be expanded through the range from weak to strong deformations—its simplicity and physical transparency describe various membrane phenomena."
