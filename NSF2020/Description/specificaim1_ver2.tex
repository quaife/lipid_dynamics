\section{Proposed Research}
\label{sec:proposed-work}
The proposed research develops fast,
high-order-accurate, parallel numerical algorithms for large-scale
simulations of the collective hydrodynamics of amphiphilic particles in a viscous solvent.
%
We have demonstrated that our potential approach efficiently simulates
self-assembly of amphiphilic particles into two-dimensional micelles, bilayer membranes, and vesicles \cite{Fu19}, and
recreates the tank-treading phenomenon in external shear flows \cite{Fu20}.
%
While the results show great promise in the field of collective body hydrodynamics,
several outstanding issues need to be addressed. These include a thorough 
analysis of potentially new mechanical properties possessed by HAP bilayers, and 
efficiently simulating three-dimensional collective hydrodynamics of amphiphilic particles.
Finally, we must mathematically characterize the variational behavior of HAP under certain homogenized limits.

Hamm and Kozlov (HK) pioneered the modern theory of membrane continuum mechanics in the early 2000s \cite{HaKo2000}.
The HK framework assumes a three-dimensional, internal structure for lipid monolayers and 
then uses the theory of elasticity to derive an effective, two-dimensional elastic energy.
The internal structure consists of straight fibers that represent elongated hydrocarbon chains, and these fibers
tilt and stretch with respect to the dividing surface. The elastic theory assumes an energy density that is
quadratic in the Green-Lagrange strain tensor. Due to the internal structure ansatz, the elastic energy decomposes into
four, fundamental and independent deformations: splay, saddle splay, twist and tilt.
The elastic moduli for each deformation comes from a transversal moment of the internal stress.
These moduli define the mechanical properties of lipid monolayers and bilayers.

(Importance, take from Akimov PRE and Zimmerberg Soft Matter)

Recently, there has been a revival in interest in the HK theory. The HK framework assumes a quadratic
elasticity energy density and this has caused researchers in molecular dynamics to question the validity of
the continuum theory \cite{PRL}. Zimmerberg and Akimov \cite{}, however, showed that for simplified deformations.
that molecular dynamics and continuum theory agree even at small length scales. 

The elastic energy of monolayer is a function of the material coordinate and its derivatives. 
That is because the changes in free energy, in elasticity theory, come from changes in spacing between mass points in a material.
There are a number of mathematical models of membrane elasticity in applied mathematics. Our HAP formulation, however,
is the first to explicitly consider intermolecular repulsion, and hydrophobic interaction with the solvent 
to calculate the free energy of a lipids in a monolayer.

What is the mathematical definition of a lipid monolayer and a deformation? 
The reference state will lipids lying on a flat surface with their tails pointing in the 
vertical direction. For concreteness, take the reference region to be the triangular prism 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{R}_0 = \{(X_1, X_2, X_3) \mid 0 \leq X_1, 0 \leq X_2, X_1 + X_2 \leq a, 0 \leq X_3 \leq \delta \}
\end{equation}
The parameter $\delta$ is the monolayer height and $a$ is the edge length for the triangular base $\mathcal{T}$. 
The size and shape of the base is arbitrary. 

The deformed state maps the flat base $\mathcal{T}$ to a curved surface $\mathcal{S} = x_0(\mathcal{T})$. 
The vertical line segments in $\mathcal{R}_0$ represent
hydrocarbon chains and map to line segments  in the deformed state.
A director field $\mathbf{n}(\mathbf{x})$ for $\mathbf{x} \in \mathcal{S}$ specifies the direction. 
Based on these considerations, the deformation takes the form  
\begin{equation}
x(X_1, X_2, X_3) = x_0(X_1, X_2) + \zeta(x_0(X_1, X_2), X_3) n(x_0(X_1, X_2))
\end{equation}    
To satisfy incompressibility, the chains stretch and compress parallel to their axis, but do not form kinks.
For a point $P \in \mathcal{S},$ the function $\zeta(P, X_3)$ parametrizes the changes in change length and 
$n(P)$ is the chain axis.  
To simplify matters, we perform the calculations at one point on the surface. 
Thus, assume, without loss of generality, that $x_0(0,0) = (0,0,0) = O$.

The field of membrane continuum mechanics still lacks concensus as to the form of the elastic energy when
it involves complicated deformations. Recently, Deserno included a tilt gradient term that was proportedly incorrectly neglected from the HK theory.
Later Akimov and Deserno independently realized that there was inconsitency regarding the transversal invariance
of tilt in Desrno's earlier work. The latest revision of HK theory by Akimov contains more than ten independent
contributions to the elastic energy. We have found that the explosion in the number of elastic terms
is a result of expanding the energy density in an incorrect reference frame, and that using a natural
reference frame leads to a simplified energy resembling the Frank theory from the study of liquid crystals. 

Our investigations will leave open the possibility that the free energy of monolayers and bilayers is non-local. 
We have shown that hydrophic attraction is a non-additive force, meaning the force of attraction between two
particles is dependent on the position a third or more particles. Conceptually, this would arise in continuum theory if two monolayer surfaces
had different elastic energy density at that point despite having locally identical curvatures and directors.

Revision 

We conjecture that the monolayer shapes 
possess some or all of the mechanical properties of bilayers from continuum theory. 

The mechanical properties of bilayer are characterized by the Helfrich Hamiltonian;
\begin{equation}
\label{ansatz3}
\begin{aligned}
\int_{\Sigma} 
%&= \tfrac{1}{2}\KB\left[ \left( \tr \mathsf{D} + k_0\right)^2 - k_0^2\right] 
%+ \tfrac{1}{2}\KT (\mathsf{D}_{21} - \mathsf{D}_{12})^2 + \KG  \det \mathsf{D}\\
 \tfrac{1}{2}\KB\left[ \left( \Div \mathbf{d} + k_0\right)^2 - k_0^2\right] 
+ \tfrac{1}{2}\KT (\Curl \mathbf{d})^2 + \KG  \det \mathsf{D} \,dA.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
This hamiltonian is the energy functional for one monolayer,
represented by a smooth surface $\Sigma$ and director field $\mathbf{d}$
 \cite{Helfrich73, PhysRevLett.113.248102, Hamm2000}.
The surface $\Sigma$ coincides with the monolayer neutral surface. The 
unit length director $\mathbf{d}$ tracks lipid orientations  
and points from the lipid head toward the lipid tail \cite{doi:10.1021/jp075641w,KLAUDA20083074}.
In a bilayer, the energy is the sum of the two monolayer energies. 
%These monolayers are typically coupled
%by requiring apposing lipid tails to terminate at the same point. 

The form of the elastic energy density \eqref{ansatz3} is the same as
the Oseen-Frank energy density for nematic liquid crystals \cite{ANDRIENKO2018520,Tran7106}.  In fact,  
a lipid monolayer acts as one layer in a smectic  phase \cite{REYESMATEO1995978,Rangamani20140463,PhysRevLett.113.248102}. 
The constants $\KB$, $\KT$  and $\KG$ play the same role as the Frank constants $K_1$, $K_2$ and $K_{24}$
liquid crystal theory. 
The Helfrich hamiltonian derives from the assumption of a quadratic energy density
in the director surface gradient 
$[\mathsf{D}]_{ij} = \frac{\partial \mathbf{d} }{\partial \tau_i} \cdot \tau_j,$ $i,j = 1,2,$ 
where $\tau_1$ and $\tau_2$ are orthogonal tangent vectors. Thus, the 
director gradients in \eqref{ansatz3} couple to surface geometry. 
Symmetries  with respect to mirror reflection and in-plane rotation 
require that the energy come from
\emph{splay} ($\Div \mathbf{d}$), 
\emph{twist} ($\Curl \mathbf{d}$)
or \emph{saddle-splay} ($\det \mathsf{D}$) distortions,
where $\Div$ and $\Curl$ are the surface divergence  and curl  operators, respectively (Figure \ref{fig:distortions}A--C).
The associated elastic coefficients  are the \emph{bending modulus} $\KB$,  \emph{twist modulus} $\KT$ 
and \emph{saddle-splay modulus} $\KG$.

The \emph{spontaneous curvature} $k_0$ depends on lipid composition and determines the preferred lipid splay,
\cite{RoLi15,Kozlov2007}. 
Figure \ref{fig:distortions}A illustrates positive splay. 
The lipid DSPC, for instance, has $k_0 = -0.1$ nm$^{-1}$ 
%as a result of  %having a relatively long acyl chain. 
and these lipids would line the  inner monolayer of a 
spherical liposome, because the addition of a positive splay $\Div \mathbf{d}$  in \eqref{ansatz3}
to the negative spontaneous curvature $k_0$ leads to lower energy \cite{Kamal22245, C3SM51829A, RoLi15,FriedSeguin15}.
The subtraction of $k_0^2$ makes the energy distortion 
free\footnote{The  ``bend'' distortion from nematics  
is not present in monolayers since the directors have no dependence in the normal direction,  \ie the 
Frank ``bend'' constant $K_3$ should not be confused with the \emph{bending modulus} $\KB.$ 
There is also no ``spontaneous twist'' in monolayers due to invariance under mirror reflection.}. 

The Helfrich hamiltonian is widely used to determine energy barriers of fusion between lipid bilayer membranes \cite{ChKo08}. 
%Some of these barrier heights were never before obtained through the use of continuum membrane mechanics.
PI Ryham and collaborators calculated, for the first time in continuum theory, a least energy path for transitions between planar bilayers, a membrane stalk, hemifusion diaphragm and the fusion pore  \cite{RyWaCo13, RyKlYaCo16}. 
%The calculation of hydrophobic 
%fissures in \cite{RyKlYaCo16} motivated the HAP theory. 
These studies 
%analyzed the dependence of energy barriers on
%lipid composition and 
found that each of the transitions required on the order of 30 \kBT\; (Figure \ref{fig:barriers}A),
a result that is in agreement with barrier heights derived by recent molecular dynamics and experimental studies
\cite{FrRoPi17}.  
(Throughout the proposal, \kBT\; = 4.11$\times 10^{-21}$ J.)

\subsubsection{Evidence for elastic properties}
\label{sssec:evidence}
We tested for elastic properties by subjecting two-dimensional bilayer morphologies
to external loads \cite{Fu19}, using realistic
values for phospholipid length \cite{Boal},
the screening length $\rho = 2.5$ nm \cite{Eriksson1989,Lin2005,Parsegian,Israelachvili80,TerziDeserno17}
and  interfacial tension $\gamma=4.1$ pN nm$^{-1}$  \cite{GarciaSaez, KUZMIN2005, Petelska2012}.
We first considered a planar bilayer subject to a uniform vertical load on the particle centers (Figure \ref{fig:bend}). 
The bilayer is clamped and horizontal at one end and the restoring force in the free part 
of the bilayer opposes the load. Twist and saddle splay are both zero, singling out splay
as the only distortion.
% In this situation, the directors are also parallel to the unit surface
%normal. As such $\Div \mathbf{d} = -2H$ where $H$ is the mean curvature of the surface. 
Since deformations are small \eqref{ansatz3}, it is possible to solve the bilayer loading in closed form. 
This analytical solution (red curve) basically overlaps the midplane of the particle based solution (Figure \ref{fig:bend}A).

\end{wrapfigure}
Experimental measurements have accurately determined 
the bending modulus for several lipid types, with 
typical values lying around 10 \kBT\; \cite{Naetal15,VeBrPa15,NAGLE2000159,PhysRevLett.113.248102}.
By comparing with the exact solution, we derived a bending modulus
in the range 8.51 -- 13.54 \kBT, which is in 
excellent agreement with the experimentally derived value, especially considering how few parameters the HAP 
formalism involves. 

We also considered the stretching deformation \cite{Fu19}. 
Stretching occurs whenever there is an excess monolayer area,
and it is energetically costly since it exposes hydrocarbon tails to water. 
%Monolayers are not, strictly speaking, area incompressible,
%and 
Manipulation experiments give a monolayer area modulus in the range 
30 -- 40 \kBT\; nm$^{-2}$ \cite{Nagle17, Nagle17-2}. 
To measure an area modulus, we stretched a circular vesicle, modeling the cross-section 
of a bilayer tube (Figure \ref{fig:bend}B \& C).
%We then stretched the vesicle beyond and beneath equilibrium radius and recorded the change in energy. 
This procedure gave a monolayer area modulus 
34 $\pm$ 2 \kBT \;nm$^{-2}$, independently of the vesicle size, which
is also remarkably close to the experimental value.  

The successful outcomes of our preliminary tests suggest that the HAP particle configurations 
do behave like an elastic material. To validate our conjecture, we must consider 
ways to isolate or partially isolate the remaining distortions. 
The twist deformation, for example, has a modulus in the range of 1 to 2 \kBT\; 
as evaluated by molecular dynamics \cite{LeVeWa14}. 
But twist is mathematically zero in our two-dimensional monolayers,
and so we require a computationally efficient means for evaluating the 
boundary integral equations in a collection of three-dimensional particles. 
Specific Aim 2 discusses some of the outstanding implementation issues. 


Our eventual three-dimensional calculations must also consider the saddle-splay distortion,
and the calculations may help resolve some well-known issues in the theory \cite{TerziDeserno17}. 
Theoretical analysis of lipid phase transitions predict a negative saddle-splay modulus around $-8$ \kBT\;
\cite{SIEGEL2004366,SIEGEL20085200}.
This value, however, 
predicts an energy barrier for monolayer fusion on the order of 200  \kBT, which runs counter to 
the value 30 \kBT\; estimated in experiments \cite{RyKlYaCo16,FrRoPi17,Tran7106}.  
We expect the particle-based approach can shed light on this inconsistency.
